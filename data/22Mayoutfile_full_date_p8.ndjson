Government has taken up with States / UTs for implementing measures such as door-step delivery of foodgrains, correct identification of beneficiaries, improve foodgrains offtake, monitoring and vigilance, improving viability of fair price shop operations. Best practices among States/UTs in TPDS implementation are shared for use by other States/UTs. With a view to modernize the system, the Government has initiated a Plan Scheme on End-to-end Computerisation of TPDS Operations on cost sharing basis with States/UTs which would facilitate digitization of ration cards/ beneficiary and other databases, computerisation of supply-chain management, setting up of transparency portals and grievance redressal mechanisms.", "state": ["Andhra Pradesh"], "gender": ["Male"], "constituency_type": ["GEN"], "party": ["TDP"], "constituency": ["Hindupur"], "month": "July", "day": "15", "year": "2014", "date": "2014-07-15T00:00:00", "date_str": "15-07-2014"}

(a) & (b): There is no scientific evidence of declining soil/crop productivity from judicious use of chemical fertilisers. However, indiscriminate and imbalanced use of fertilizers coupled with low addition of organic matter over years may result in multinutrient deficiencies. There is also the possibility of contamination of ground water due to excessive use of nitrogenous fertilisers, particularly in light textured soils, that has consequence on human health if used for drinking purpose.  (c) & (d): Government is recommending soil test based balanced and integrated nutrient management through conjunctive use of both inorganic and organic sources of plant nutrients to reduce the negative impact of chemical fertilizers. In addition, Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) is advocating split application and placement of fertilizers, use of slow releasing N-fertilizers and nitrification inhibitors, growing leguminous crops and use of Resource Conservation Technologies (RCTs). ICAR also imparts training, organizes frontline demonstrations to educate farmers on these aspects.  Under Soil Health Management (SHM) component of National Mission for Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA), financial assistance for training to farmers including field demonstrations on balanced used of fertilisers is provided @ Rs.10,000 per training for 20 or more participants. Financial assistance for frontline field demonstrations is also provided @ Rs. 20,000 per demonstration.  (e): Government is promoting organic farming through various programmes, namely, National Project on Organic Farming (NPOF) under NMSA, Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH), Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY) and Network Project on Organic Farming under ICAR. Under the National Project on Organic Farming (NPOF), Government is promoting production of various organic inputs in the country including biofertilizers. NPOF provides financial assistance upto 25% of total financial outlay upto a ceiling of Rs.40 lakhs as credit linked back-ended subsidy for setting up Bio-fertilizer production units.

The details of civilians and security forces personnel injured are not centrally maintained.  (b) & (c): No specific intelligence inputs are available to indicate that the maoists/ naxalites are getting external/foreign assistance in the country. However, the CPI (Maoist) party have close links with foreign maoist organizations in Philippines, Turkey etc. The outfit is also a member of the Coordination Committee of Maoist Parties and Organisations of South Asia (CCOMPOSA). The maoist parties of South Asian countries are members of this conglomerate. Besides, Left Wing Extremist (LWE) groups have participated in conferences/ seminars conducted in Belgium and Germany. The so-called Peoples War being waged by the CPI(Maoist) against the Indian State has also drawn support from several maoist fringe organisations located in Germany, France, Holland, Turkey, Italy etc.  The recovery of arms and ammunitions of foreign origin from the Left Wing Extremists in different encounters / operations is an indication of the fact that they are procuring weapons from different sources also. Moreover, the possibility of some front organizations of the CPI(Maoist) clandestinely getting foreign funds cannot be ruled out. Inputs also indicate that some senior cadres of the Communist Party of the Philippines imparted training to the cadres of CPI(Maoist) in 2005 and 2011.  The Government is closely monitoring the situation and taking appropriate action as required. Such matters, as and when they come to the notice of this Ministry, are taken up with the Ministry of External Affairs, who take up the issue with the countries concerned at the diplomatic level.  (d) & (e): The Central Government has a four pronged strategy to tackle LWE insurgency - Security Related Measures; Development Related Measures; Ensuring Rights & Entitlements of Local Communities and Public Perception Management, wherein it supplements the efforts of the State Governments.  In security related interventions, apart from directly deploying Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs), the Government of India provides assistance for capacity building of the states through schemes like the Security Related Expenditure (SRE) Scheme, the Special Infrastructure Scheme(SIS), the Construction/Strengthening of Fortified Police Stations Scheme etc. In addition, other security related interventions include providing helicopters to States, setting up of Counter Insurgency and Anti Terrorism (CIAT) schools, assistance to raise India Reserve Battalions (IRB), modernization and upgradation of the State Police and their Intelligence apparatus under the Scheme for Modernization of State Police Forces (MPF scheme) etc.  On the development front, the Central Government is implementing special schemes for LWE affected areas like the Additional Central Assistance (ACA) Scheme (in place of old Integrated Action Plan), the Road Requirement Plan-I (RRP-I) etc.  To ensure Rights & Entitlements of local communities, the Central Government has enacted the Scheduled Tribes and other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 to recognise and vest the forest rights and occupation in forest land in forest dwelling scheduled tribes and other traditional forest dwellers, who have been residing in such forests for generations, but whose rights could not be recorded. The Rules were notified on 01.01.2008 have been further amended on 06.09.2012 to ensure better implementation. The Ministry of Tribal Affairs have also issued comprehensive guidelines on 12.07.2012 on issues relating to implementation of the Act.  Under Public Perception Management, the Central Government is implementing the Media Plan to convey the Governments view to the people of LWE affected areas through the Media.  It is the belief of the Government of India that a combination of calibrated police action, focused development efforts and improvement in governance are the effective instrumentalities to combat LWE insurgency in the long-term.", "state": ["Maharashtra", "Maharashtra"], "gender": ["Male", "Male"], "constituency_type": ["GEN", "GEN"], "party": ["BJP", "SHS"], "constituency": ["Bhiwandi", "Thane"], "month": "July", "day": "15", "year": "2014", "date": "2014-07-15T00:00:00", "date_str": "15-07-2014"}

SANJEEV KUMAR BALYAN)  (a) & (b). Various diseases of livestock like Haemorrhagic septicaemia and Foot and Mouth disease (FMD) are regularly reported from different parts of the country. Haemorrhagic Septicaemia (HS) is caused by bacteria (Pasteurella multocida) which generally inhabits respiratory tract of the animals. The bacteria flare up due to stress (high humidity and high temperatures) in animals resulting in the fatal disease. FMD, a viral disease mostly occurs in unvaccinated animals/areas. State-wise details of outbreaks, attacks and deaths due to HS and FMD as reported by States for last three years and the current year are given in the annexure.  (c) As per information available on deaths of livestock due to HS and FMD, 11261 cattle and buffaloes, 840 sheep & goats and 37 pigs died during 2011, 2012, and 2013. Though the exact data on loss in monitory terms for the death of animals is not available due to varying age, breed and category (milch or draught type) of died animals, however, presuming all animals as milch animals and norms prescribed for cow, buffalo and sheep & goat under National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF), the maximum loss on account of deaths of cattle & buffaloes is estimated at Rs.1.5 crore, Rs. 2.7 crore and Rs. 14.28 crore, Rs. 0.93 crore respectively during the years 2011,2012, 2013 & 2014 (upto April, 2014).

(c) All nuclear power plants have an Off-site Emergency Preparedness Plan duly reviewed by AERB and approved by District Collector. In this emergency preparedness plan, roles and responsibilities of various plant authorities and state agencies involved in handling emergency are identified. Depending on the spread of contamination, the required actions need to be taken in affected area, which may include sheltering, distribution of iodine tablets, control of food stuff or evacuation of the area. The plan also identifies the routes for evacuation. Emergency exercises are also held at regular intervals to validate the plans and make improvements if any. All administrative and logistic arrangements are arranged/supervised by State Government authorities. NPCIL sites have hospitals equipped to handle radiation exposure cases. The compensation in the event of a nuclear accident would be guided by the provisions of the Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Act, 2010 and Rules framed under the Act. Extremely robust safety systems and practices are in place in all Indian nuclear reactor sites. Any acute exposure of radiation to members of the general public, requiring prompt medical intervention even in case of an extremely unlikely event of any accident in our Nuclear Power Plants (NPPs) is not expected.  Even in the case of the Fukushima-Diiaichi accident, the World Health Organisation Report released in February 2013 on the health risk assessment (adopting a highly conservative approach) shows that, Fukushima-Daiichi accident has not resulted in acute radiation effects among workers. None of the seven reported deaths among workers is attributable to radiation exposure; and that the possible impact on the population affected is practically insignificant. Similarly, the Press Release following the 60th Session of the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effect of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR) held in May 2013 reports the conclusion of the Session:  Radiation exposure following the nuclear accident at Fukushima-Daiichi did not cause any immediate health effects. It is unlikely to be able to attribute any health effects in the future among the general public and the vast majority of workers. It further reports, that, On the whole, the exposure of the Japanese population was low, or very low, leading to correspondingly low risks of health effects in later life.

Under Urban Infrastructure Development Scheme for Small and Medium Towns (UIDSSMT) of JnNURM, the guidelines stipulates inter-alia that 50% of the Central share will be released on signing of Memorandum of Agreement to the State nodal agency, after ascertaining availability of State share. The balance 50% of the Central share would be released on submission of Utilization Certificates by nodal agency for 70% of funds (Central & State grants) released earlier.  (b): State-wise details of total allocation and Additional Central Assistance (ACA) released for utilization during the Mission period under UIG and UIDSSMT of JnNURM are at annexure-I & annexure-II.

(c) to (e): (i)Under UIG of JnNURM, the release of further instalment of Additional Central Assistance (ACA) is dependent upon receipt of Utilization Certificates (UCs) to the extent of 70% of grants (Central and State) and subject to the achievement of milestones agreed for implementation of mandatory and optional reforms at the State and ULB/Parastatal level as envisaged in the MoA. As states and cities have not completed all reforms as per timelines, the release of instalments was withheld leading to stoppage of work and consequent cost escalation, complication of contractual obligation and poor quality of project implementation etc, the Government on 01-12-2010 approved that for the remaining Mission period,in case of UIG projects where significant progress has been made in the implementation of reforms by the States/Cities, Additional Central Assistance may be released after withholding 10% of the central share. States may use their own funds to meet the balance amount and complete the ongoing projects and obtain reimbursement of the withheld amount upon completion of reforms.  (ii) Similarly under UIDSSMT, the Government de-linked the reform implementation with release of funds for 2nd instalment for the ongoing projects in the States of North Eastern Region & State of Jammu and Kashmir. It was also further stipulated that the 2nd instalment for the ongoing projects sanctioned under UIDSSMT may be released to those ULBs that have completed 4 out of the 6 mandatory ULB level reforms, including 2 reforms relating to Property Tax to the extent of 60% coverage of Properties and 70% collection efficiency and in respect of reforms on Recovery of Operation & Maintenance (O&M) cost through User Charges to the extent of 70% are achieved and those ULBs which are not able to achieve the specified relaxed standards, the work may be carried out with the funds available with these States and the fund would be reimbursed if reforms to the extent as mentioned above are achieved by 31.03.2014.  (iii) Funds were released to all States/UTs under UIG and UIDSSMT after relaxed reform conditions for timely completion of projects sanctioned so that the benefit of projects are accrued to the public.

Specific details of particular wildlife habitats facing destruction or damage on account of mining activities are recorded and appraised at the time of appraisal of the proposals for mining as and when required for environmental clearance, forest clearance and consideration by the Standing Committee of National Board for Wildlife, as per the statutory requirement.  The Government has taken the following measures to regulate mining including in forest and wildlife habitats and for minimizing the environmental impacts:  (i) Mining activities are subject to the environmental clearance process under the Environment Impact Assessment Notification, 2006. For environmental appraisal of mining projects including coal mining, Expert Appraisal Committees are in place, which inter alia seek relevant information on impact of wild life habitats, and propose appropriate conditions in this respect.  (ii) In case the proposed mining is located within forest area, the activity is also subject to appraisal by the Forest Advisory Committee set up under the Forest (Conservation) Act 1980.  (iii) In case the proposed mining area is located within a National Park or Wild Life Sanctuary, the proposal is also required to be considered by the National Board for Wild Life (NBWL)/through its Standing Committee as per the provisions of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972.  (iv) For ensuring a safety zone around the National Parks and Sanctuaries, Government has also introduced a system of notification of ecologically important area around National Parks and Sanctuaries as Ecologically Sensitive Zones (ESZ), in which activities impacting the wild life habitats can be further appraised and regulated. The ESZs are notified under section 3 of Environment (Protection) Act, 1986.

As per the data available with the Botanical Survey of India, out of 19,156 species of vascular plants (Angiosperms, Gymnosperms, Pteridophytes) so far recorded from the country, 1236 species belong to different threatened categories like Critically Endangered, Endangered, Vulnerable, etc. Among animals, as per the Red Data Book of International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources, 57 species have been identified in India as Critically Endangered in various classes namely birds (13 species), mammals (11 species), reptiles (6 species), fishes (5 species), amphibians (19 species), Spiders (2 species) and Corals (1 species).  (c) Towards conservation of rare & threatened species, Government of India has established protected area networks such as National Parks, Sanctuaries, Biosphere Reserves, Ramsar sites for in-situ conservation besides other traditional conservation practices like sacred groves which primarily covers habitats of threatened megafauna such as tiger, rhino, elephant etc. Conservation oriented legislation namely Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 and Biodiversity Act, 2002, regulate the protection of forests and access to their components, including the rare species. Under the provisions of Section 38 of Biodiversity Act 2002, state wise identification of species is carried out for taking conservation measures. In this regard, Ministry has already issued notifications for 14 States viz. Himachal Pradesh, Kerala, Uttar Pradesh, Uttrakhand, Mizoram Orissa, Meghalaya, Goa, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal, Bihar, Tamil Nadu and Tripura. Legal protection has been provided to many species of wild animals and plants against hunting and commercial exploitation under the provisions of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, which has been amended & made more stringent. The State Governments have been requested to strengthen the field formations and intensify patrolling in and around the Protected Areas.  BSI has brought a number of threatened plants under cultivation in its Acharya Jagdish Chandra Bose Indian Botanic Garden in Howrah, Botanic Garden Indian Republic, Noida and other associated botanic gardens of its regional centres for their ex-situ conservation, thereby complementing the in-situ conservation of such species in protected areas established in different bio-geographical regions of the Country. In addition to these, Botanical Gardens associated with universities/Institutes have also successfully conserved/multiplied several threatened plants with the help of Ministry under its Assistance to Botanic Garden scheme.

SHRIRANG APPA BARNE AND SHRI. ADHALRAO PATIL SHIVAJIRAO FOR REPLY ON 16.07.2014:  (a) and (b) Yes Sir. Wildlife in the country is under stress due to illegal trade of wildlife and their parts. Illegal trade is demand driven and demand especially for the Indian iconic species is from international markets. Indian wild species and their parts most commonly reported in illegal trade are  tiger, rhinoceros, elephant, leopard, snow leopard, chiru, civet cat, otter, bear, musk deer, tortoise, turtles, reptiles, pangolins, sea cucumber, sea horse, tockay gecko and birds such as grey jungle fowl, parakeets, owls and mynas etc.  The number of cases of illegal trade of endangered flora and fauna detected at exit points during last three years are as under: Year    Violation    Total   CITES  Wild Life   EXIM Policy      Protection      Act, 1972 2011-12  122  91   99  312 2012-13  82  84   56  222 2013-14  172  49   36  256 The Wildlife Crime Control Bureau (WCCB) has been mandated to, inter alia, co-ordinate with law enforcing agencies and international organizations and to facilitate universal action for wildlife crime control and also to implement obligations under the various international Conventions and protocols that have been ratified or acceded to by India.  Since its constitution, the Bureau has been taking up the issues related to illegal trade in wildlife with various foreign authorities including neighbouring countries and international organizations such as INTERPOL and CITES Secretariat. The major steps taken in this regard with the neighbouring countries are as under:  (i) Wildlife smuggling has been included in the agenda of bilateral meetings on border cooperation between India and Myanmar. An MoU on border cooperation has also been signed between India and Myanmar. The MoU includes designation of Nodal points and sharing of information for wildlife crime control.  (ii) Trans-border illegal wildlife trade is discussed in the Transboundary consultative meetings on biodiversity conservation between Nepal and India.  (iii) Illegal trade in wildlife is discussed in the bilateral meetings on wildlife management between India and China.  (iv) WCCB representatives are attending meetings of South Asia Wildlife Enforcement Network (SAWEN) and ASEAN  Wildlife Enforcement Network (ASEAN-WEN), and taking up the issues of mutual interest on illegal wildlife trade with the representatives of Member States.  (v) Efforts are on to include wildlife smuggling in the agenda for bilateral interactions with relevant neighbouring countries.  (vi) India has signed a Protocol with Republic of China AND Bangladesh for taking up joint measures to crack down on illegal activities of poaching of tigers, smuggling and selling of tiger bones and their derivatives. A Memorandum of Understanding has been signed with Nepal to establish a Joint Task Force to check trafficking across the borders.  (c) and (d) Yes Sir. An Environment and Social Framework Document in consultation with World Bank was part of development of a project entitled Strengthening Regional Cooperation for Wildlife Protection in Asia proposed in 2011-12 for IDA funding of US$ 30 Million from World Bank under Third Phase of Adaptable Programme Lending. The project was part of Strengthening Regional Cooperation for Wildlife Protection project of the World bank.  (i) Capacity building for wildlife conservation and cooperation for addressing the illegal trans-boundary wildlife trade (US$ 20.52 million): For regional harmonization and collaboration in cross-border wildlife conservation and management, combating wildlife crime through strengthened legislative and regulatory frameworks, enforcement agencies, as well as relevant training and awareness programs for staff across the range of agencies that contribute to the enforcement of wildlife laws and regulations namely the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Wildlife Crime Control Bureau.  (ii) Promoting Wildlife Conservation in Asia (US$2.95 million): The objective of this component is to generate and share knowledge as well as technical expertise by promoting research and innovative approaches on emerging challenges in wildlife conservation.  (iii) Project coordination and communication (US$5.04 million): Under this component, expenditure of US$ 0.76 million is estimated for project management and monitoring. The remaining amount is to be spent on project communications, wherein a multi-pronged approach will be adopted to communications in order to meet regional and local challenges.  However, the credit agreement has not been signed with the World Bank and negotiations have not been held so far. No financial assistance has been received from the World Bank.  (e) Step taken by the Government to intensify wildlife conservation efforts are as follows:  1. Hunting and commercial exploitation of wild animals included in various schedules of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 are prohibited. Offences committed in respect of these species attract punishment prescribed under the Act.  2. The Wildlife Crime Control Bureau has been set up to strengthen the enforcement of law for control of poaching and illegal trade in wildlife and its products.  3. Protected Areas, viz., National Parks, Sanctuaries, Conservation Reserves and covering important wildlife habitats have been created all over the country under the provisions of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 to conserve wild animals and their habitats.  4. Financial and technical assistance is provided to the State/Union Territory Governments under the Centrally Sponsored Schemes of Integrated Development of Wildlife Habitats, Project Tiger and Project Elephant for providing better protection to wildlife and improvement of its habitat.  5. The State/Union Territory Governments have been requested to strengthen the field formations and intensify patrolling in and around the Protected Areas.", "state": ["Maharashtra", "Maharashtra"], "gender": ["Male", "Male"], "constituency_type": ["GEN", "GEN"], "party": ["SHS", "SHS"], "constituency": ["Maval", "Shirur"], "month": "July", "day": "16", "year": "2014", "date": "2014-07-16T00:00:00", "date_str": "16-07-2014"}

GOVERNMENT OF INDIA DEPARTMENT OF ATOMIC ENERGY  STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION No.128 DUE FOR ANSWER ON 16.07.2014 BY NIMMALA KRISTAPPA REGARDING SHORTAGE OF ATOMIC FUEL.  (a) Yes, Sir.  Currently, the country has 20 nuclear power reactors under commercial operation with an installed generating capacity of 4780 MWe. Under the separation plan, ten of our commercially operating reactors are currently placed under International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards and are eligible for imported fuel. These reactors are RAPS 1 to 6 located at Rawatbhata, Rajasthan; KAPS 1&2 at Kakrapar, Gujarat and TAPS 1&2 at Tarapur, Maharashtra. Of these, one reactor, RAPS-1 located at Rawatbhata, Rajasthan (100 MWe) is under extended shutdown for techno-economic assessment. The remaining 9 reactors normally operate at their full capacity. In addition, KK1&2 at Kudankulam, Tamil Nadu are also under IAEA safeguards.  Ten nuclear power reactors viz., KGS 1 to 4 located at Kaiga, Karnataka; NAPS 1 & 2 at Narora, Uttar Pradesh; MAPS 1 & 2 at Kalpakkam, Tamil Nadu; and TAPS 3 & 4 at Tarapur, Maharashtra continue to use indigenous uranium. Due to a mismatch between demand and supply of domestic Uranium, the total power generated by these reactors is generally lower than their gross installed capacity of 2,840 MWe. However, following extensive work for exploration of Uranium in the country, the supply of Uranium from Indian mines is progressively improving and accordingly, capacity utilisation of these ten reactors has increased during last three years.  (b) The expenditure incurred on import of uranium during each of the last three years and the current year, country-wise is as under:  Year Natural Uranium   Uranium Ore  Di-oxide Pellets  Concentrate  from JSC TVEL  from NAC  Corporation,  Kazatomprom,  Russia      Kazhakhstan  Quantity  Landed Cost  Quantity  Landed Cost   imported (MT) (` in Cr.) imported (MT) (`in Cr.) 2011-12 295.0  440.83  350.0  318.24 2012-13 295.0  444.60  402.5  414.67 2013-14 295.0  537.26  460.0  375.11 2014-15 118.0  144.26  -  - (c) As stated in the Joint Press Statement on the State Visit of the Prime Minister of Australia to India on 17 October 2012, the bilateral Civil Nuclear Cooperation Agreement is a prerequisite for uranium sales from Australia to other countries. Discussions have been initiated with Australia on the proposed bilateral Civil Nuclear Cooperation Agreement.  (d) With the extensive work for exploration of Uranium in the country to augment indigenous sources, the supply of Uranium from Indian mines is progressively improving. So far, 2,11,473 tonne of U3O8 equivalent to 1,79,329 tonne of Uranium has been established by Atomic Minerals Directorate for Exploration and Research (AMD) in various States of India. Further, consequent upon India signing the Civil Nuclear Cooperation Agreement with United States of America on 10.10.2008, the Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) has been importing Uranium ore to supply fuel for the Nuclear Reactors under IAEA Safeguards as per the separation plan. As a part of this activity, Contractual Agreements were entered into with M/s. AREVA, France (during 2008), M/s. JSC TVEL Corporation, Russia (during 2009), M/s.

Statement referred to in reply to parts ( a) to (e) of Lok Sabha Starred Question No.133 to be answered on Wednesday, the 16th July, 2014 on Ganga River Basin Management by Kumari Shobha Karandlaje & Shri Prathap Simha.  (a) to (c) Under National Ganga River Basin Authority (NGRBA) programme, a Memorandum of Agreement (MoA) was signed on 6th July, 2010 between Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change and consortium of seven Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) for preparation of a comprehensive River Basin Management Plan for Ganga (GRBMP). The first phase of the plan was to be completed within 18 months from the date of signing the MoA and the duration of this MoA was for a period of 10 years from the date of its signing.  The main objectives of the plan are to suggest comprehensive measures for restoration of the wholesomeness of the Ganga river system and improving its ecological health taking into account the issue of competing water uses in the river basin. The Plan would take into consideration the requirements of water and energy in the Ganga Basin, to accommodate increased population, urbanization, industrialization and agriculture while ensuring that the fundamental aspects of the river system i.e., (i) river must have longitudinal and lateral connectivity, (ii) river must continuously flow (Aviral Dhaara), (iii) river must have adequate space for its various functions, (iv) river must function as an ecological entity, and (v) river must not be seen as a carrier of waste loads (Nirmal Dhaara), are protected.  (d) So far, an interim report and 36 thematic draft reports have been submitted, which have been circulated to different stakeholders including concerned Ministries and departments for comments/views.  (e) Major recommendations given in the draft reports are:  (i) to adopt the principle of river connectivity with maintenance of scientifically assessed Environmental Flows(E- Flow) of River Ganga and her major tributaries, especially in the context of dams and barrages. Consequently, water allocations for different sectors may need re-evaluation.  (ii) to adopt the concept of river space for protection of active floodplain and encroachment.  (iii) to value fresh water at minimum one and half times the cost of recycled treated sewage and industrial wastewater.  (iv) treatment of sewage up to tertiary level for Class I and Class II Towns, and move toward reuse-recycle practice (and disposal of excess tertiary wastewater into rivers or on land).  (v) to introduce concept of internalizing the cost of environmental damages due to disposal of solid and liquid residues from industries and shift towards Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) and reuse/recycle of treated industrial effluents.  (vi) preparation of Urban River Management Plans (URMPs) for Sewage Collection, Diversion, Pumping, Treatment and Reuse and for Riverbank Protection for all Class I and Class II Towns with Technical, Financial and Advisory Support from National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG).  (vii) to adopt integrated management of aquatic resources instead of managing conventional water resources in isolation or in a piece-meal manner.  (viii) demonstration of setting up Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs) and Effluent Treatment Plants (ETPs) on Design-Build-Finance-Operate (DBFO) model based on Public-Private Partnership (PPP) approach through NMCG.  (ix) create a comprehensive Ganga River Basin Information and Communication (GBIC) Network related to all aspects of River Ganga with participation of local community.

PATIL, Hon`ble Member of Parliament  (a) Yes sir.  (b) Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change (MoEF & CC) got a comprehensive environmental assessment of 88 prominent industrial clusters carried out based on the Comprehensive Environmental Pollution Index (CEPI) criteria in 2009. Out of these 88 industrial clusters, 43 industrial clusters with CEPI score 70 and above were identified as critically polluted areas (CPAs). The state-wise list of above 43 critically polluted areas is enclosed as Annexure-I. Six such CPAs namely, Ankleshwar, Vapi, Ahmadabad, Vatva, Bhavnagar, Junagarh are located in Gujarat.  (c)& (d) This Ministry had imposed temporary moratorium on 13.01.2010 on consideration of projects for environmental clearance to be located in the above 43 CPAs. Later, based on inputs regarding action plans prepared by the concerned State pollution Control Boards/Pollution Control Committees (SPCBs/PCCs) for improving the environmental quality in these areas and actions initiated, as also re-assessment of CEPI score done by CPCB of these areas, this Ministry has lifted moratorium from different CPAs time to time subject to certain stipulations. As of now, there is no moratorium in 36 out of 43 CPAs. Seven CPAs which are still under moratorium are Ankleshwar (Gujarat), Chandrapur (Maharashtra), Pali (Rajasthan), Vatva (Gujarat), Vellore (Tamilnadu), Nazafgarh Drain Basin (UT Delhi) and Jodhpur (Rajasthan).  CPCB has been asked to get the re-assessment of CEPI score done in all 43 CPAs taking into account all constituents of index as originally formulated in 2009. Appropriate view in the matter would be taken upon receiving input from CPCB.

Successful completion of the digitization of TV Signal transmission will result in the complete closure of analogue transmission and could act as an enabler to add value and to increase profits at each level in the value chain. It is estimated to bring about a further drop in the carriage fees, and drive growth in Average Revenue Per Units (ARPU), thereby increasing profitability.

Under both phases of GAP, a total of 575 schemes have been sanctioned for undertaking pollution abatement activities in the identified polluted stretches of the river Ganga,  of which 524 schemes with a capacity to treat pollution load of 1098 million litres per day (mld) have been established.

Further, as per Indias Second National Communication (2012), the trends of sea level rise are estimated to be an average of 1.3mm/year along Indian coasts.

The study published in the Journal of Threatened Taxa predicts inundation of bio-geographical zones of India by marine intrusion as result of 1 m and 6m sea level rise. It also predicted the impact of sea level rise on coastal areas including Godavari- Krishna mangrove eco-region and the Sunderband based on 1m and 6 m sea level rise scenario.

RETD. V.K. SINGH)  (a) As part of the Passport Seva Project (PSP), a Mission Mode Project, implemented by the Government with a view to comprehensively overhaul passport issuance system, 77 Passport Seva Kendras (PSKs) as per enclosed list (Annexure I), have been set up and operationalised as extended arms of the existing 37 Passport Offices across the country. Since the launch of Pilot PSKs in May 2010 to 30th June, 2014, 1,53,29,306 Passports have been issued in the new system.  (b) to (d) (i) The Passport Portal, www.passportindia.gov.in, is web-based and can be accessed by anyone, anytime and anywhere. The citizens are free to apply online and obtain appointments themselves or seek the assistance of anyone else to obtain appointments. The applicants are required to log on to the Passport Portal; create their user ID and assign a password; fill & submit the application form online or download the e-form, fill & upload the same at the portal (applicants may scan and upload supporting documents, if they so desire); schedule an appointment after making payment of passport fee online through debit/credit card or State Bank of India (SBI) net-banking or SBI Challan; and along with a print-out of Appointment Slip/Challan, original documents and photocopies, visit the concerned PSK for submission of application.  (ii) With a view to address the challenge of digital divide in the country, especially in the rural hinterland, the Government in association with M/s. CSC e-Governance Services India Limited {which is promoted by the Department of Electronics and Information Technology (DeitY)}, has facilitated online filing of passport applications, through the vast network of over one lakh CSCs across rural hinterland. The CSCs which are the delivery points for Government, Private and Social Sector services in the area, facilitate filling and uploading of Passport application form, payment of applicable fee and scheduling of appointment for visit to the PSK, at nominal charge not exceeding Rs. 100/-. As per the appointment schedule, the applicants visit the PSK for completion of application submission process. The services through CSCs are available throughout the week, including during the weekend.  (iii) The online appointment system has been introduced to minimize waiting time for applicants. Appointments are allotted according to handling capacity of PSKs and are based on electronic queue management system. The number of public dealing counters has been increased from the erstwhile 350 to 1610 in the new system and public dealing hours have gone up from 4 hours to 7 hours a day.  (iv) The entire process is online and streamlined including interface with the Indian police for verification of personal particulars of applicants and with India Post for tracking delivery of passports. Status of applications can be tracked through the passport website or through mPassport Seva. An e-mail based helpdesk facility and a 24x7 National Call Centre has been set up to provide requisite information to citizens in 17 languages. An SMS message is sent to the citizen as soon as the passport is dispatched. For assistance, one can call toll-free helpline 1800-258-1800.  (v) Applicants presence in person at the PSK enables the Passport Issuing Authority to capture their photograph and fingerprints to prevent the incidence of impersonation. The applicants also get full opportunity to see and affirm their personal particulars to be entered in the passport to avoid unnecessary correspondence later.  (vi) Walk-in facility has also been allowed to citizens having Application Registration Number (ARN) to enable them to apply for Tatkaal service, issue of Police Clearance Certificate (PCC), deletion of Emigration Clearance Required (ECR) status, inclusion of name of spouse in the passport and issue of new booklets where pages have been exhausted. Senior citizens above 60 years, minors below 15 years whose parents hold valid passports, differently-abled persons, Central/State government employees and their spouse/dependent minor children having ARN have also been permitted walk-in facility.  (vii) Amenities in every PSK include photocopying, food and beverage, public phone booth, baby care room, newspapers and television in a comfortable air-conditioned environment while the applicants obtain passport services.  (viii) The Project is supported by state-of-the-art technology infrastructure which enables end-to-end passport services to be delivered with enhanced security. A complex algorithm has been built in to highlight cases of possible duplication and suppression of information by the applicant.  (ix) The PSP system also has the potential of integration with other e-governance initiatives of the Government.  (x) Security has been given special attention in the Project. The accountability of the employees as well as the Service Providers personnel, in respect of any task performed in the PSP system, is ensured through three-level authentication comprising Biometric log-in, User ID/Password and Digital Signatures.  (xi) Passport Offices conduct Passport Melas at PSKs on weekends from time to time for meeting high demand of passports. Passport Adalats, on need basis, are also conducted by Passport Offices to redress passport service grievances by dealing with citizens directly.  (xii) As police verification of personal particulars and antecedents of applicants is critical to Passport issuance, Passport Offices keep in touch with Police to expedite Police Verification reports.  (xiii) A Handbook of Standard Documents & Procedures for PSK officials has been circulated to all the Passport Offices for speedy processing of passport applications.  (xiv) A Productivity Linked Incentive Scheme has been implemented aimed at increasing productivity of the Central Passport Organisation officials.", "state": ["Andhra Pradesh", "Kerala", "Rajasthan"], "gender": ["Male", "Male", "Male"], "constituency_type": ["GEN", "GEN", "ST"], "party": ["YSRCP", "CPM", "BJP"], "constituency": ["Nellore", "Palakkad", "Udaipur"], "month": "July", "day": "16", "year": "2014", "date": "2014-07-16T00:00:00", "date_str": "16-07-2014"}

Of the above identified capacity, 35,944.5 MW hydro capacity is under operation, 13,131.3 MW hydro capacity is under construction and 63,432 MW hydro capacity is under other various stages of development. The State-wise details of the hydro potential and its development is given at Annex.  It is expected that the total hydro potential of the country could be tapped by the end of 17th Plan, which would offset, to some extent, the energy deficit in the country.  (d) & (e): Hydro power is the renewable, Non-polluting and an environmentalfriendly source of energy. Among the primary resources of energy, it is the only renewable source which has been recognized to be economical in the long run and  preferred source of energy due to its inherent benefits like peaking power, long life span, generate the employment for local people which leads to overall development of area and cost effective in long run because no fuel cost is involved during their operation.  The measures taken by the Government for time bound development of hydro potential so as to ensure its optimum harnessing for the benefits of its people and progress of the country are given below:   (i) National Electricity Policy: The policy lays maximum emphasis on full development of the feasible hydro potential in the country which will facilitate economical development of States, particularly North Eastern States, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh and Jammu & Kashmir. Since the hydel projects call for comparatively larger capital investment, debt financing of longer tenure has been recommended. The State Governments have been advised to review procedure for land acquisition and other approvals / clearances for speedy implementation of hydro projects. Full support of Central Government has been extended for hydel development by offering the services of CPSUs like NHPC, NEEPCO, SJVNL, THDC etc.   (ii) Hydro Power Policy- 2008: Salient Features (including subsequent changes):  Hydro Power Policy, 2008 has been notified by Govt. of India on 31.3.2008. The salient features of the policy are given below:  # The cost plus Tariff regime (in which tariff is to be determined by the regulator under section 62 of Electricity Act, 2003) has been extended for public as well as private sector hydro power projects up to December 2015.  # Transparent selection criteria for awarding sites to private developers.  # Enables developer to recover his additional costs through merchant sale of upto a maximum of 40% of the saleable energy. 5% reduction for a delay of every six months.  Balance long term PPAs.  # For 10 years from the COD, developer to provide 100 units of electricity per month to each PAF - in cash or kind or a combination of both.  # Project developer assists in implementing rural electrification in the vicinity of the project area and contributes the 10% share of the State Govt. under the RGGVY scheme.  # Additional 1% free power from the project for a Local Area Development Fund, - regular revenue stream for welfare schemes, creation of additional infrastructure and common facilities.  # The State Governments are also expected to contribute a matching 1% from their share of 12% free power.   (iii) Monitoring Mechanism / Other measures  # Central Electricity Authority (CEA) is monitoring the power projects in pursuance of Section 73 (f) of Electricity Act, 2003. The progress of each project is monitored continuously through frequent site visits, interaction with the developers and critical study of monthly progress reports. Chairperson, CEA holds regular review meetings with the developers and other stakeholders to sort out the critical issues. # A Power Project Monitoring Panel (PPMP) has been set up by the Ministry of Power to independently follow up and monitor the progress of hydro projects.  # Review meetings are taken by Ministry of Power regularly with the concerned officers of CEA, equipment manufacturers, State Utilities/ CPSUs/ Project developers, etc. to sort out critical issues.  # Review meetings are held in the Ministry/CEA on regular basis.  # Inter-Ministerial consultations for expediting various issues relating to development of HEPs, especially with the MoEF, Border Roads Organisation, Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, Ministry of Defence and Ministry of Home Affairs etc.   (iv) National Rehabilitation & Resettlement Policies:  National Rehabilitation & Resettlement Policy 2007 addresses the need to provide succor to the asset less rural poor, support the rehabilitation efforts of the resource poor sections, namely small and marginal farmers, SCs/STs and women who have been displaced. Besides, it seeks to provide a broad canvas for an effective dialogue between the Project Affected Families and the Administration for Resettlement & Rehabilitation to enable timely completion of project with a sense of definiteness as regards costs and adequate attention to the needs of the displaced persons. The rehabilitation grants and other monetary benefits proposed in the Policy are minimum and applicable to all project affected families.

The responsibility of development of other waterways rests with the respective State Government. The following waterways have been declared as National Waterways (NWs):-  (i) Ganga-Bhagirathi-Hooghly river system (Allahabad-Haldia-1620 km) in the State of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal as NW-1, declared in 1986.  (ii) River Brahmaputra (Dhubri-Sadiya-891 km) in the state of Assam as NW-2 declared in 1988.  (iii) West Coast Canal (Kottapuram-Kollam) along with Udyogmandal and Champakara Canals-205 km) in the State of Kerala as NW-3 declared in 1993.  (iv) Kakinada-Puducherry canal along with Godavari and Krishna rivers (1078 km) in the State of Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Union Territory of Puducherry as NW-4 declared in 2008.  (v) East Coast Canal integrated with Brahmani river and Mahanadi delta rivers (588 km) in the State of West Bengal and Odisha as NW-5 declared in 2008.  (b)&(c): National Waterway-3 was declared w.e.f. February-1993. As per the detailed project report prepared by M/s RITES, capital dredging to the tune of 40.33 lakh cu.m has to be carried out over a length of about 87 km to develop a navigational channel with 32 m bottom width in narrow stretches and 38 m bottom width in wider stretches with 2.2 m depth. As on date about 5.16 lakhs cu.m of dredging is to be carried out over a length of about 7.95 km for which the work is in progress. The progress of work has been severely hampered due to non provision of suitable dumping sites for the dredged spoil by the State Authorities, resistance by local people for dredging and their agitation in the process of dumping the dredged materials.  (d)&(e): No proposal has been received for declaring a waterway as a National Waterway from any of the State Government. East Coast Canal integrated with Brahmani river and Mahanadi delta rivers (588 km) was declared as National Waterway-5 in November-2008. Subsequent to the declaration of the waterway as National Waterway-5, detailed project report for its development for shipping and navigation was prepared. The Planning Commission advised to explore the possibility of developing commercially viable stretches of this waterway under Public Private Partnership (PPP) mode. Accordingly, after conducting meeting with the stakeholders, Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI) explored the possibility of developing the identified commercially viable stretches under public private partnership mode. However, this has not been found feasible. Hence, efforts is being made to develop the waterway in a phased manner with budgetary support. An MoU (Memorandum of Understanding) with Government of Odisha, Paradip Port and Dhamra Port Company Ltd. was signed by IWAI on 30th June, 2014 for developing the commercially viable stretch of 332 km in phases.", "state": ["Odisha", "Kerala"], "gender": ["Male", "Male"], "constituency_type": ["GEN", "GEN"], "party": ["BJD", "INC"], "constituency": ["Sambalpur", "Ernakulam"], "month": "July", "day": "17", "year": "2014", "date": "2014-07-17T00:00:00", "date_str": "17-07-2014"}

(a) The extant policy guidelines for provision of stoppage of trains at station inter-alia stipulates that the minimum number of tickets to be sold at the station so as to recover the cost of stoppage (which ranges from Rs. 4376/- to Rs. 5396/- depending upon traction, composition and other factors) should be 40 or more per day per train for sleeper class for a distance of 500 kms. or its equivalent in terms of cost for mixed class of passengers like AC, General and distance (multiple of 100 kms.) toward/from destination/originating stations of the train. The cost of stoppage is based on the prices of 2005-06. The policy also provides for additional criteria like population, significance, new developments taking place in and around the station, nature & occupancy of the train whose stoppage has been demanded, operational constraints and effect of the stoppage on the line capacity of the section and punctuality of trains, passing time of the train at station in question and availability of alternative service(s) and occupancy thereof etc. Halt stations are opened on public demand if found financially viable and feasible from operating and engineering points of view. Opening of halt stations is also considered on passenger amenity grounds.  (b)& (c) Requests for provision of stoppage of trains at various stations and opening of halt stations are received at various levels of Railway administration, a compendium of which is not maintained. These are examined and action as found feasible and justified is taken within the purview of the extant policy guidelines. Experimental stoppages for specified period are, however, provided to assess the need for the stoppage and its impact on train operation.

Statement referred to in reply to parts (a) to (d) of Lok Sabha Starred Question No.156 for answer on 17.07.2014 asked by Shri B. Sriramulu  (a): The Government had approved the New Coal Distribution Policy (NCDP) on 18.10.2007 in supersession of the then existing coal distribution policy for core and non-core sectors and other instructions issued from time to time. The existing classification of consumers into core and non-core was reviewed and it was decided to dispense with the same. Instead, it was decided that, each sector/consumer would be treated on merit, keeping in view, inter-alia, the regulatory provisions thereto and other relevant factors.  (b) to (d): The requests for grant of long term coal linkage/Letter of Assurance (LoA) have been received from various States including Karnataka. Requests in respect of Thermal Power Projects (TPPs), including Edlapur (1x800 MW), Yermarus TPP (2x800 MW) and Beilary (Unit-3) (1x700 MW) in Karnataka were forwarded to the Ministry of Power for recommendations. Ministry of Power subsequently recommended these three TPPs for grant of coal linkage. These recommendations have not yet been placed before the Standing Linkage Committee (Long Term) {SLC(LT)}for a decision.  Keeping in view the negative coal balance reported by subsidiary coal companies of Coal India Limited (CIL), no new linkage/ Letter of Assurance (LoA) has been granted to any of the sectors since 2010. Further, subsidiary companies of Coal India Limited (CIL) have issued 175 LoAs covering the capacity of 1,08,000 MW. Out of this 1,08,000 MW capacity, the competent authority in 2013 had approved signing of Fuel Supply Agreements (FSAs) in respect of 78,000 MW capacity power plants which have been commissioned or are likely to be commissioned by 31,03.2015. It was further decided that coal may also be supplied to power plants of 4660 MW capacity and other similarly placed power plants that do not have any fuel linkage subject to the availability of coal and on the condition that such supplies would not adversely impact the availability of coal for the identified plants of 78,000 MW capacity as per the approval accorded for Letter of Assurance holders. Bellary unit-3 of 700 MW capacity, which is expected to be commissioned by March, 2015, is part of identified 4660 MW capacity. A Presidential Directive to this effect was issued to CIL on 17.07. 2013. The power projects of the remaining capacity of 30,000 MW are yet to be authorized for signing of FSAs.

As the demand for travel surges especially during the peak season, general coaches in trains witness overcrowding. However, to cater to these peak surges in travel demand, Indian Railways runs special trains including fully un-reserved special trains and also augments coaches subject to operational feasibility, traffic demand and availability of resources etc. As a matter of policy, all new Mail/Express trains introduced after 2007-08 have at least 6 general coaches in their standard composition, except fully reserved trains like Rajdhani, Shatabdi, Duronto etc. Besides, to cater to the unreserved traffic, certain long distance trains like Jan Sadharan Express, Janseva Express, Jannayak Express & Passenger trains and some short distance Intercity are run with only General Second Class accommodation.  Regular analysis and review of occupancy pattern is being undertaken, and every year in the Budget, new trains and increase in the frequency of existing trains are announced. During peak season and surges in demand for travel, trains are being augmented with additional coaches, depending on the waiting-list position, operational feasibility and availability of coaches. Special trains are also planned to clear seasonal rush, as well as on special occasions such as Melas, Urs, Festivals, Exams etc. In the year 2013-14, about 41386 special trains trips and 132514 extra coach trips were run, while 778 coaches including 231 general class coaches were deployed for permanent augmentation. Further, in the 2014-15 Railway Budget (including the interim Budget), 138 new trains, extension of 15 trains and increase in frequency of 4 trains has been announced including five new Jansadharan Express trains (i.e. fully unreserved trains).", "state": ["Bihar"], "gender": ["Male"], "constituency_type": ["GEN"], "party": ["JD(U)"], "constituency": ["Nalanda"], "month": "July", "day": "17", "year": "2014", "date": "2014-07-17T00:00:00", "date_str": "17-07-2014"}

Statement referred to in the reply to Lok Sabha Starred Question No. 155 (15th Position) due for answer on 17.07.2014  (a) The per capita availability of water in the country was 1816 cubic meters as per 2001 Census which was reduced to 1545 cubic meters as per 2011 Census as reported by Ministry of Water Resources , Government of India. Per capita availability of drinking water in the country is not monitored by the Ministry .At present under National Rural Drinking Water Programme (NRDWP) guidelines, the per capita minimum norm for drinking water is 40 litres per capita per day (ipcd).The States may however, fix their own higher norms based on water availability, demand , capital cost involved affordability etc.  (b) The Ministry monitors the availability of drinking water in rural areas of the country in terms of habitations .The present status of drinking water supply in terms of fully/ partially covered and quality affected habitations in the country States/UTs wise is at Annexure-1.  (c) Drinking Water Supply is a Stale subject. Under National Rural Drinking Water Programme (NRDWP) , this Ministry provides financial and technical assistance to States to supplement their efforts to provide adequate safe drinking water to rural population. The details of the funds allocation , sanctioned and utilized by the States during the last three years and the current year as per the Integrated Management Information System {JMIS) of the Ministry , State/UT wise is at Annexure-11.  (d) Some States were not able to fully utilise the funds released to them last year and also during previous years. The status of funds remaining unutilized by the States/UTs during the last three years is at Annexure-lll.  The reasons for some Stales not being able to spend the amounts released to them may be attributed to delays in procurement processes, taking up multi-village schemes that require 2-3 years for completion, imposition of mode! conduct code due to declaration of elections /bye elections etc.  Various mechanisms have been put in place to ensure that the States are able to utilize the funds released to them. The Slate Governments are required to prepare an Annual Action Plan in advance to implement various components and activities of the NRDWP. They have to mark the targeted habitations and provide details of works, schemes and activities in the on-iine IMJS. Coverage and progress data is also to be entered in the on-line IMIS. Further, Senior OlTicers/Area Officers/Technical Officers tour (lie Slates to assess the implementation of the Programme.  (e) The Ministry has prepared a Strategic Plan for rural drinking water supply for the period 2011-2022, covering the two Five Year Plan periods, which stresses on extending the piped water supply to more households in the rural areas. The interim goal till 2017, is to cover 50% of all rural households with piped water supply, and 35% of rural households with household tap connections. By 2022, the goal is to cover 90% rural households with piped water supply and with 80% having household tap connections. To achieve this, the Ministry does the following:  (i) Focus on coverage of Partially Covered habitations.  (ii) Focus on coverage of Water Quality affected habitations with safe drinking water.  (iii) Focus on providing drinking water to rural population through piped water supply.  (iv) Motivating rural population to take tap connections to their households.  The Ministry also conducts meetings of the Secretaries in charge of rural water supply, regional review meetings, video-conferencing, etc. through which implementation of NRDWP is monitored.", "state": ["Karnataka", "Bihar"], "gender": ["Female", "Male"], "constituency_type": ["GEN", "GEN"], "party": ["BJP", "NCP"], "constituency": ["Udupi chikmagalur", "Katihar"], "month": "July", "day": "17", "year": "2014", "date": "2014-07-17T00:00:00", "date_str": "17-07-2014"}

The Committee has recommended that the design of towers should be reviewed as per the latest Indian Standard codes for further strengthening, and to avoid theft of tower members, patrolling in theft prone areas be intensified.

SADANANDA GOWDA)  (a) to (d) A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.  STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (d) OF STARRED QUESTION NO. 158 BY SHRI JAI PRAKASH NARAYAN YADAV TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 17.07.2014 REGARDING LATE RUNNING OF TRAINS  (a) & (b) Yes, Madam. While Railways continuously monitor the punctuality of passenger carrying trains, right from the time they commence their journey till they terminate, at the Divisional, Zonal and Board level, it also assesses the extent of delay and takes effective remedial steps, both short and long term to control the factors which impede the running of trains.  Running trains as per schedule is governed by a variety of factors, many of which fall within the purview of railway working and others on which Railways have little or no control. The former relate to reliability of assets, time-tabling, constraints of line capacity and terminal capacity, non-availability of surplus stock for controlling rescheduling of trains etc, the latter concerns delays due to grid failures, cattle run over cases, public agitations, bandhs, bad weather (including fog), miscreant activity (including alarm-chain pulling), running of unscheduled pilots ahead of Mail/Express trains in areas having law and order problems etc. Occurrences of some of factors mentioned above have a cascading impact on the movement of trains especially on saturated sections and delay the movement of all subsequent trains.  As the individual train wise details would be too voluminous, a summarized comparative position of the cause-wise analysis of major factors affecting punctuality leading to a delay in train running for the years 2013-14 & 2012-13 (Table 1) and details of duration-wise delays in June, 2014 (Table 2) is given below :  Table 1 :     2013-14   2012-13 Factors    No. of  % share  No. of   % share     trains  of total  trains  of total     lost  trains  lost  trains       lost    lost Beyond railways control   26287  28.7  30503  29.2 (Alarm chain pulling,  Miscreant activity,  agitation, unusual  incidents including  accidents, bad weather  like fog, cattle run-over,  law and order, LC Gate,  others) Asset failures    16326    17.8    21625    20.7 (Failures related to  Diesel/ electric  locomotives, carriage and  wagon, OHE/Grid,  Engineering, Signal &  Telecom, electric  defects etc.) Other than above  48887    53.4    52321    50.1 (Including line capacity  constraints, congestion  resulting from asset  failures/traffic surges,  regulation due to  accidents, maintenance  blocks for electrification,  non-interlock working,  track/bridge repairs, new  works/construction etc.) It will be seen from the table given above that there has been a reduction in both categories of factors in 2013-14 over 2012-13 which has led to an improvement in punctuality in 2013-14 over 2012-13 as given below: Table 1.1 : Year  No. of M/E  % increase in  Punctuality    % improvement   trains run  no. of trains  achieved  in Punctuality   per day  per day   (%) 2011-12  1348  -   74.86   - 2012-13  1430  6.08    79.42   4.56 2013-14  1505  5.24   82.67   3.25 Table 2 : Delay duration in minutes ? Less than 60 minutes Above 60 minutes Ratio of delayed trains  1%     15% to total trains run per  day Most of these trains undergoing delay incidentally pass through the oversaturated and critical trunk routes. Train delays become accentuated on these sections, mainly because there are no dedicated tracks for passenger services and any turbulence in the system immediately has a cascading impact on train operations in general and passenger-carrying trains in particular which are time-sensitive.  (c) & (d) Railways, in general, accord a very high priority to the punctual running of trains. The Indian Railways have put in place the IT enabled Integrated Coaching Management System (ICMS) which helps the online monitoring of punctuality of passenger carrying trains. This module consists of Punctuality Analysis and Monitoring (PAM) and Coaching Operation Information System (COIS) which continuously monitors the running of trains, thus enabling the Zonal Railways to take prompt decisions in according priorities in train movement, making-up time on run of delayed trains, ramping up resources at terminals to reduce rescheduling of trains arriving late on account of delayed running, training and counseling of supervisors and loco crew, monitoring of alertness of field staff through punctuality drives etc.  Improving train operations is a continuous endeavour on Indian Railways. With a view to controlling the impediments which lead to train delays, concrete steps have been taken by way of completing infrastructural works in over-saturated sections  doubling, third/fourth line, additional loop line, platforms, signalling improvements like  automatic signalling, panel interlocking/RRI installations, replacing token system to token less system of block working, railway electrification for seamless working, rationalizing the existing time table  revisiting the dwell time at stoppages, adjustment of time amongst Zonal Railways to accommodate additional stoppages/speed restrictions/new infrastructural works etc. In addition, resources are mobilised to replace Level Crossing gates by low-height sub-ways and reaching out to State Governments in obtaining their acceptance for construction of Road Over Bridge (ROB) and Road Under Bridge (RUB) in lieu of these gates. In this pursuit, 162 doubling projects (Rs. 32,708 crore), 43 gauge conversion (Rs. 19,170 crores) and 155 new line projects (Rs. 1, 22,548 crores) and 703 traffic facility works - like construction of new terminals, augmentation of existing terminals, bye-passes etc. (Rs 5247 crores) are already sanctioned. Thus, in the long term, completion of these works, which would depend on the availability of funds, will further streamline train operations which will in turn benefit running of trains to their schedules. In addition, the operation of eastern and western dedicated freight corridors will ease out line capacity constraints on existing routes and these are likely to further improve punctuality in Indian Railways.", "state": ["Bihar"], "gender": ["Male"], "constituency_type": ["GEN"], "party": ["RJD"], "constituency": ["Banka"], "month": "July", "day": "17", "year": "2014", "date": "2014-07-17T00:00:00", "date_str": "17-07-2014"}

Statement referred to in reply to parts (a) to (c) of Lok Sabha Starred Question No.159 for answer on 17.07.2014 asked by Shri Rakesh Singh and Shri P.C. Gaddigoudar  (a): The subsidiary coal companies of Coal India Limited (CIL) are supplying coal to all Thermal Power Plants (TPPs) in accordance with the provisions of Fuel Supply Agreement (FSA). In terms of FSA, third party sampling and analysis facilities at loading ends are provided to the power utilities for assessment of quality of coal at loading end jointly and thereby loading of proper quality coal to power companies is ensured. As per the provisions of FSA, the consumers are to make payment of coal bills in accordance with the quality of coal so determined at loading end for sampling and analysis by the third party in presence of the representative of the consumer. Besides, in accordance with the provisions of FSA, power plants are compensated for the Stone/Boulders of (+) 250 mm size segregated at the unloading end, after joint assessment.  (b): CIL and its subsidiary coal companies have received some complaints from power companies/TPPs and other consuming units in the country including the power plants in Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka regarding oversized coal and coal mixed with some stones/boulders, which altogether cannot be ruled out due to unique geo-mining conditions and/or factors present in Indian coal seams.  (c): The subsidiary coal companies of CIL put their best efforts to segregate and remove the foreign bodies present in the coal seams. In view of the complex nature of coal seams, some extraneous material can get mixed with the raw coal being supplied, for which provision for stone compensation is kept in the FSA. Since coal is heterogeneous in nature, the inherent ash content in coal seams cannot be ruled out totally. However, to reduce ash content and remove impurities present in the coal, thereby improving the quality of coal, CIL and its subsidiaries are adopting new technologies such as Selective Mining, Surface Miners etc. For improving quality of coal, the corrective measures taken by CIL and its subsidiary coal companies are asfollows:- (i) Selective mining of bands of thickness more than 1 meter. (ii) Appropriate positioning of overburden and coal benches to avoid contamination. (iii) Scrapping/cleaning of coal benches before blasting. (ivj Installation of metal detectors / magnetic separators over running conveyors before coal loading. (v) Crushing arrangement is also provided for supply of sized coal for better consumers satisfaction. (vi) All the major projects having high capacity coal handling plants dispatch sized and uniform quality of coal to suit the requirement of the consumers. (vii) Bomb Calorimeters provided at all the area laboratories/ at all the major projects for regular quality assessment. (viii) Participation of consumer representatives in joint sampling and / or third party sampling and analysis of coal, based on which consumers are provided with the facility of adjustment of payment against coal value. (ix) Awareness programmes and imparting training to the personnel involved in production of coal regarding importance of coal quality and need to improve and maintain the same during mining operations. (x) Shale picking, if any, at mine face, stocks, sidings and from the wagons. (xi) Beneficiation of non-coking coal in washeries have been planned for `Build Operate & Maintain` (BOM) basis in addition to the existing capacity of non-coking coal. Further a revised mechanism for third party sampling is being put in place by CIL to make it more transparen", "state": ["Karnataka", "Madhya Pradesh"], "gender": ["Male", "Male"], "constituency_type": ["GEN", "GEN"], "party": ["BJP", "BJP"], "constituency": ["Bagalkot", "Jabalpur"], "month": "July", "day": "17", "year": "2014", "date": "2014-07-17T00:00:00", "date_str": "17-07-2014"}

(b) & (c) Despite best endeavours of Indian Railways to run trains, including superfast trains, to time, trains including superfast trains, at times, do run late. While Indian Railways do maintain a list of trains running late through the computer based Integrated Coaching Management System (ICMS), list of superfast trains running late by 5-6 hours, thereby forcing them to lose their superfast character, is not maintained, at present, as it does not form a part of ICMS reporting.  Indian Railways, with a view to improve the punctuality of train, monitors the running of all superfast and non-superfast trains at divisional, zonal and Board level. However, occasions do arise when trains including superfast, get delayed due to factors beyond Railways control like law and order, natural calamities, grid failure, fog, accidents, etc. and certain factors relating to Railway operations like asset failures, rescheduling, maintenance blocks, infrastructural works in progress, etc.  Action both long term and short term are initiated to improve punctuality by sensitising the static and dynamic staff involved in train operations, so that trains make up time on run, asset failures are corrected in the shortest possible time and preventive maintenance is given priority. Resources are allocated to improve the infrastructure by initiating traffic facility works and terminal works especially on saturated routes to surmount the impediments that affect punctuality. In the event of late running of a superfast train by more than three hours, if a passenger does not want to undertake his journey, no cancellation fees or clerkage charges is levied and full fare including superfast surcharge is refunded to the passengers subject to the condition that the ticket is surrendered up to the actual departure of the train and in case of e-tickets, the TDR is filed online before the actual departure of the train. At present, there is no proposal to do away with superfast surcharge due to late running of superfast trains.

As a result, water has become a relatively scarce resource in some areas of the country. With a view to augmenting the water resources for irrigation, domestic, and industrial consumption, several measures are being undertaken by the respective State Governments which, inter-alia, include conservation of water resources in reservoirs & traditional water bodies, rain water harvesting and artificial recharge of ground water. To facilitate this, the Central Government provides technical and financial assistance to the State Governments through various schemes and programmes such as Accelerated Irrigation Benefits Programme (AIBP) and Repair, Renovation and Restoration of Water Bodies etc.  To ensure adequate availability of funds for these Schemes, the Twelfth Five Year Plan Document has indicated an increased total outlay of about Rs.4,22,012 crore under the Water Resources Sector.  The National Water Policy (2012) also highlights the need for conservation, development and management of water resources in the country. Copies of the National Water Policy, 2012 have been forwarded to all State Governments/Union Territories and concerned Ministries/Departments of Central Government for appropriate action. Besides, the Central Ground Water Board has prepared a Master Plan for Artificial Recharge of Ground Water Aquifers in the Country. It has been shared with States and Union Territories for implementation.  (c)&(d) Central Ground Water Board (CGWB), under Ministry of Water Resources had undertaken the Demonstrative Rain Water Harvesting and Artificial Recharge Projects during XI Plan under the Scheme of Ground Water Management & Regulation.  Consultations with representatives of State Governments are periodically held at various Conferences/Meetings including meetings of National Water Resources Council etc. to discuss the problems associated with the water sector and measures needed to resolve them.

(h) The steps taken by the Government for effective implementation of MGNREGS are as under:-  # It has been proposed that at least 60% of the works to be taken up in a district in terms of cost shall be for creation of productive assets directly linked to agriculture and allied activities through development of land, water and trees.  # It is proposed that the wage-material ratio for works taken up by agencies other than Gram Panchayats would be counted at the district level to facilitate taking more durable assets.  # The associated outcomes of each work would be estimated before taking up the work and the same would be measured after completion of the work  thereby bringing in more focus on outcomes.  # The quality of the assets is sought to be improved through better planning and closer technical supervision.  # States/UTs have been asked to operationalize the provision relating to compensation for delayed wage payments as per Para-29, Schedule II of MGNREGA 2005.  # States/UTs have been asked to strengthen Social audits of MGNREGS works in accordance with the provisions of the Audit of Schemes Rules 2011 issued in consultation with the Comptroller and Auditor General of India.  # With a view to avoid bogus attendance and to check instances of tempering and misuse of muster rolls, the e-Muster system has been introduced.  # For smooth fund flow, the electronic Fund Management System (e-FMS) has been introduced which would also reduce delays in payment of wages.  # All States have been requested to appoint Ombudsman at the district level for grievance redressal.  # The State and district level Vigilance and Monitoring Committees have been established for monitoring of the scheme.

(SHRI SANTOSH KUMAR GANGWAR)  (a) CGWB has prepared a conceptual document entitled Master Plan for Artificial Recharge to Ground Water in India during the year 2013, which envisages construction of different types of Artificial Recharge and Rainwater Harvesting structures in the Country in an area of 9,41,541 square km by harnessing surplus monsoon runoff to augment ground water resources. Further, the National Water Policy (2012), which has been forwarded to all State Governments/UTs and concerned Ministries /Departments of Central Government for appropriate action, also highlights the need for augmenting the availability of water through direct use of rainfall. Initiatives for water conservation and water recharge are being undertaken by the respective State Governments which, inter-alia, include conservation of water resources in the reservoirs and traditional water bodies, rainwater harvesting and artificial recharge of ground water. Central Government provides technical and financial assistance to the State Governments through various schemes and programmes to facilitate this.  (b) Government of India promotes water conservation measures in the Country, by supplementing efforts of State Governments for augmentation, conservation and efficient management of water resources by way of technical and financial support through various schemes and programmes such as Accelerated Irrigation Benefit Programme (AIBP) and Repair, Renovation and Restoration of Water Bodies etc. A National Water Mission, has also been set up to inter-alia, promote conservation of water resources. To ensure adequate availability of funds for these Schemes, a sum of Rs.109553 crore has been earmarked for the Water Resources Sector during the XIIth Plan.

(c) On the basis of the preliminary data collection and analysis, NATRIP made the following recommendations in the report of the preliminary enquiry in other to reduce crashes of this kind:  1) Proper signage should exist on the highway. Features such as narrowing of lanes and presence of culverts as well as other features such as turns, rough roads, merges and exits, etc. should be properly highlighted.  2) There should be no gaps in crash barriers. Culverts should not have an exposed edge and should be designed properly.  3) Bus manufacturers should be advised to look into having fuel tanks only towards the centre of the bus and not on the sides. This would ensure that they are not exposed to impact.  4) Bus and bus body manufacturers should be advised to have openable and easily accessible emergency exits. All glass widows should be either openable or have easily accessible hammers.  5) Tour operators should be advised to implement norms for drivers to ensure that they are not fatigued during the journey.

NHAI has intimated necessary action on the recommendations of the Road Safety Expert. Automotive Research Association of India (ARAI) and Central Institute of Road Transport (CIRT) have been requested to minutely examine the provisions relating to emergency exit and other provisions of Automotive Industry Standard AIS 052: Code of Practices for Bus Body Design & Approval, and recommend necessary amendments in the AIS so as to ensure that no provision of bus code contravenes the provisions of Central Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989 (CMVRs).

HARSH VARDHAN)  (a): As per the Global Adult Tobacco Survey, India (GATS) conducted by Ministry of Health and Family welfare (2010) in the age group of 15 years and above the total number of tobacco users in India is 27.49 crores out of which 7.8 crore are females. The other key findings include:  # 20.3% of females use tobacco in any form  # 2.9% of females use smoking forms of tobacco.  # 18.4 % of females use smokeless forms of tobacco.  # 25.8% of females starting tobacco use before the age of 15.  (b) & (c): The Ministry of Health and Family welfare conducted the Global Adult Tobacco Survey, India (GATS) (2010) to monitor adult tobacco use and track key tobacco control indicators. Some of the important indicators monitored and for which the estimates are available are as under:  1. Exposure to Second Hand Smoke (SHS) :  # 30% of adults are exposed to SHS at workplace  # 52% of adults are exposed to SHS at Home,  # 17.5 of adults are exposed to SHS in Public Transport.  2. Anti-tobacco information in any Media:  # 52% of the adults noticed anti-cigarette information: 61% of the adults noticed anti-bidi information:  # 66% of the adults noticed anti-smokeless tobacco information  3. Noticing Health Warnings on Various Tobacco Products and thinking of quitting:  # 70.8% of cigarette smokers noticed health warnings on cigarette package and 38% thought of quitting because of warning label.  # 62% of bidi smokers noticed health warnings on bidi package and 29% thought of quitting because of warning label.  # 62% of users of smokeless tobacco noticed health warnings on smokeless tobacco product package and 34% thought of quitting because of warning label.  4. Knowledge, Attitude and Perceptions:  # 90% of the Adults believe that smoking causes serious illness  # 85% of the Adults believe that smoking causes lung cancer  # 63.9% of the Adults believe that smoking causes Heart Attack.  (d): Currently there is no such proposal to introduce the plain packaging. As per the Act and the Rules framed thereunder the pictorial health warnings shall occupy 40% of the Principal display areas and on the front panel of the tobacco product packages with an option of rotation every 2 years or earlier.  The Union Minister of Health & Family Welfare has written to all the Chief Ministers to consider adopting a Comprehensive Taxation Policy for all tobacco products so that they are taxed at similar rates and incentive to shift to relatively cheaper tobacco products is minimised. It is also important that under the policy, the tax rate should be linked to both inflation and changes in household income, so that any tax increase leads to an effective and real increase in the price of tobacco products, making them less affordable over time and thereby reducing consumption & prevalence. While developing such policy the studies on price and elasticity of demand also need to be kept in view. Further , Secretary, Department of Health & Family Welfare has vide letter dated 26th June, 2014 written to Secretary (Revenue) to adopt a Comprehensive Tax Policy for tobacco products in the broader public health interest and with a view to protecting youth and children from getting addicted to tobacco use.  (e): A number of steps have been taken by the Government in this regard, which include the following:  1. The Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products (Prohibitions of Advertisement and Regulation of Trade and Commerce, Production, Supply and Distribution) Act, (COTPA), was enacted in 2003 to regulate consumption, production, supply and distribution of tobacco products, by imposing restrictions on advertisement, promotion and sponsorship of tobacco products; prohibiting smoking in public places; prohibiting sale to and by minors, prohibiting sale within a radius of 100 yards of educational institutions and through mandatory depiction of specified pictorial health warnings on all tobacco product packs.  2. Government of India launched the National Tobacco Control Programme (NTCP) in the year 2007-08, with the aim to (i) create awareness about the harmful effects of tobacco consumption, (ii) reduce the production and supply of tobacco products, (iii) ensure effective implementation of the provisions under The Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products (Prohibition of Advertisement and Regulation of Trade and Commerce, Production, Supply and Distribution) Act, 2003 (COTPA) and (iv) help the people quit tobacco use through Tobacco Cessation Centres.  The coverage of National Tobacco Control Programme (NTCP) has been up-scaled from existing 42 districts of 21 states to 53 districts of 29 states in 2013-2014 under the umbrella of National Health Mission.  3. National Level Public Awareness campaign is a key activity under National Tobacco Control Programme (NTCP) which is aimed at educating people about the adverse health effects of tobacco use. A variety of media like electronic (Government and private Channels and FM/radio), outdoor billboards, bus panels, exterior train wrap-up, news- paper advertisement etc. have been used to reach a wide set of audience.  4. Health spots relating to harmful effects of tobacco use are also displayed by films and TV Programmes displaying tobacco products or their use, as per the Rules notified under COTPA, 2003.  5.

PROPOSALS FOR FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT", "clean_answers": "THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY (SHRIMATI NIRMALA SITHARAMAN)  (a): (i) Year-wise details of the proposals received during the last three years and the current year are as under :  Year No. of fresh approvals received 2011 222 2012 218 2013 219 2014 86 (till date) (ii) Year-wise details of the proposals approved/ rejected during the last three years and the current year are as under:  Year No. of proposals  No. of proposals   approved# rejected 2011 189  71 2012 199  80 2013 198  33 2014 63  15 (till date)  (# Refers to recommendation made during the year including for proposals carried forward from earlier year(s). Therefore, table in (i) and (ii) will not match.)  The Sector-wise and State/UT-wise details of the proposals for Foreign Direct Investment received and approved/ rejected by Foreign Investment Promotion Board are not centrally maintained.  (b): As on 15.07.2014, total 91 proposals are pending with Foreign Investment Promotion Board and efforts are being made to clear all the proposals at the earliest.  (c): Review of the FDI policy of the country is an ongoing process and Government has taken a number of steps in the recent past to make India an attractive investment destination. However currently there is no proposal under consideration to review the existing policy in Pharmaceutical, agricultural multi-layered marketing, direct selling industry and manufacturing of solar cells.  As regardsproposal to increase the cap in some sectors, Finance Minister, in his Budget Speech, given on 10.7.2014, has made following statement:  The policy of the NDA Government is to promote Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) selectively in sectors where it helps the larger interest of the Indian Economy. FDI in several sectors is an additionality of resource which helps in promoting domestic manufacture and job creation. India today needs a boost for job creation. Our manufacturing sector in particular needs a push for job creation.  India today is the largest buyer of Defence equipment in the world. Our domestic manufacturing capacities are still at a nascent stage. We are buying substantial part of our Defence requirements directly from foreign players. Companies controlled by foreign governments and foreign private sector are supplying our Defence requirements to us at a considerable outflow of foreign exchange. Currently we permit 26 per cent FDI in Defence manufacturing. The composite cap of foreign exchange is being raised to 49 per cent with full Indian management and control through the FIPB route.  The Insurance sector is investment starved. Several segments of the Insurance sector need an expansion. The composite cap in the Insurance sector is proposed to be increased up to 49 per cent from the current level of 26 per cent, with full Indian management and control, through the FIPB route.  To encourage development of Smart Cities, which will also provide habitation for the neo-middle class, requirement of the built up area and capital conditions for FDI is being reduced from 50,000 square metres to 20,000 square metres and from USD 10 million to USD 5 million respectively with a three year post completion lock in.  To further encourage this, projects which commit at least 30 per cent of the total project cost for low cost affordable housing will be exempted from minimum built up area and capitalisation requirements, with the condition of three year lock-in. FDI in the manufacturing sector is today on the automatic route. The manufacturing units will be allowed to sell its products through retail including E-commerce platforms without any additional approval.  (d): No such study has been conducted by the Government.  (e): Government has put in place an investor-friendly policy on FDI, under which FDI, up to 100%, is permitted, under the automatic route, in most sectors/activities.  Government plays an active role in investment promotion, through dissemination of information on the investment climate and opportunities in India and by advising prospective investors about investment policies and procedures and opportunities. International Cooperation for industrial partnerships is solicited both through bilateral and multilateral arrangements. It also coordinates with apex industry associations, such as FICCI, CII and ASSOCHAM, in their activities relating to promotion of industrial cooperation, both through bilateral and multilateral initiatives intended to stimulate inflow of foreign direct investment into India.  The Government has also set up Invest India, a joint venture company between the Department of Industrial Policy & Promotion and FICCI, as a not-for-profit, single window facilitator, for prospective overseas investors and to act as a structured mechanism to attract investment.", "state": ["Odisha", "Tamil Nadu", "Maharashtra", "Bihar", "West Bengal"], "gender": ["Male", "Male", "Male", "Male", "Male"], "constituency_type": ["GEN", "GEN", "GEN", "GEN", "GEN"], "party": ["BJD", "ADMK", "BJP", "IND", "INC"], "constituency": ["Cuttack", "Tiruchirappalli", "Akola", "Pataliputra", "Baharampur"], "month": "July", "day": "18", "year": "2014", "date": "2014-07-18T00:00:00", "date_str": "18-07-2014"}

Of these 13,74,935 AWCs/ mini -AWCs/ AODs have been sanctioned to States for operationalisation. States/ UTs have operationalised 13,41,745 AWCs/ mini-AWCs/ AODs leaving a gap of 33190 Anganwadi Centres (AWCs)/Mini-Anganwadi Centres (Mini-AWCs). State-wise details are given at Annex-I.  As per Schematic norms of the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) Scheme, Government of India is responsible for the Planning & Policy issues whereas State Governments are responsible for the implementation of the Scheme. The reasons for gap between the sanctioned and operational AWCs and Mini AWCs across the country are largely due to administrative, procedural and legal delays by the State Governments/UT Administrations. Ministry of Women and Child Development has repeatedly impressed upon the State Governments/UT Administrations to take all required measures for early operationalisation of sanctioned AWCs/ mini-AWCs.  (b), (c), (d) & (e): About 50.28% AWCs are reported to have toilet facilities, about 71.05% AWCs have drinking water facilities within the premises and 28.34% AWCs have separate kitchen as on 31.12.2012.

Drinking water and sanitation facilities are being provided in Anganwadi Centres in convergence with the Schemes of the Department of Drinking Water Supply under the National Rural Drinking Water Programme (NRDWP) and the Total Sanitation Campaign (TSC). Such convergence has been advocated from Central and State levels. A joint letter under the signatures of Secretary, WCD and Secretary, Department of Drinking Water Supply was issued to all the States/UTs on 10.2.2010 advising the States/UTs to create synergies at different levels to further the objectives of TSC and ICDS.  To facilitate and to augment convergence between the ICDS and TSC, the Ministry has also issued a letter to the Secretaries in charge of ICDS in all States/UTs urging them to utilize the TSC funds for construction of Baby Friendly Toilets in AWCs operating out of Govt. buildings and also in private buildings by utilizing the revolving fund component under the TSC. The Ministry of Rural Development has also been addressed to provide potable water at the AWCs under the Rajiv Gandhi Drinking Water Mission.  Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) Scheme did not have provision for construction of AWC buildings under the scheme as this was envisaged to be provided by the community except for the North Eastern States for which financial support was being provided for construction of AWC buildings since 2001-02 at a unit cost of Rs.1.75 lakh.  States have been requested to tap the funds for this from various schemes such as MPLADs, MLALADS, BRGF, RIDF, Panchayati Raj, NREGA and Tribal Affairs, Multi-Sectoral Development Programme (MSDP) of Ministry of Minority Affairs (MoMA), under SSA, Finance Commission, Additional Central Assistance under State Plan, Integrated Action Plan, etc.  The Government has approved strengthening and restructuring of ICDS to improve services and the facilities at AWCs which inter-alia provides for construction, upgradation & maintenance of AWC buildings, weighing machines, kitchenwares & utencils, pre-school & medicine kits, furniture etc. As a part of Strengthening and Restructuring of ICDS Scheme, Government has approved a provision for construction of 2 lakh Anganwadi Centre buildings @ Rs.4.5 lakh per unit and upgradation of 2 lakh AWC buildings @ Rs 1 lakh per unit during XII Plan period in a phased manner with cost sharing ratio of 75: 25 between Centre and State other than the NER, where it will be at 90: 10. Also, Ministry of Rural Development (MORD) has included construction of AWCs as an eligible authorized activity in the list of new works permitted under MGNREGA.

The scheme aims at holistic development of children below 6 years of age and pregnant women & lactating mothers by providing a package of six services comprising (i) Supplementary nutrition (ii) Pre-school non-formal education (iii) Nutrition and health Education (iv) Immunization (v) Health check-up and (vi) Referral services through Anganwadi Centres at grassroots level. Three of the six services viz. immunization, health check-up and referral services are related to health and are provided by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare through NRHM and Public Health Infrastructure.  (c): In so far as ICDS Scheme is concerned, as a new initiative on experimental basis, a provision of Anganwadi Centre -cum-Creche in 5% of the Anganwadi Centres (total 70,000) has been approved under the Strengthening and Restructuring of ICDS Scheme during XII Plan period. This is based on demand from the States/UTs, Funds for additional space including construction of additional room, cradles, beds, soft toys, additional supplementary nutrition, one additional Creche Worker etc. are envisaged. The cost sharing ratio between the Centre and the State for this component would be 75:25. 12653 AWC-cum-Creches have been sanctioned during 2013-14 to the States/UTs.  Besides, Rajiv Gandhi National Creche Scheme for Children of Working Mothers provides day care facilities to children in the age group of 0-6 years from families with monthly income of less than Rs.12,000/-. In addition to being a safe space for the children, the crches provide services such as supplementary nutrition, pre-school education and emergency health care, etc. This scheme envisages implementation through the Central Social Welfare Board (CSWB), Indian Council for Child Welfare (ICCW) and Bhartiya Adim Jati Sevak Sangh (BAJSS).  (d): To reduce the mortality rate among children due to malnutrition in the country, various schemes/programmes i.e. the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS), National Rural Health Mission (NRHM), Mid-Day Meal Scheme(MDM), Rajiv Gandhi Schemes for Empowerment of Adolescent Girls (RGSEAG) namely SABLA, Indira Gandhi Matritva Sahyog Yojna (IGMSY) are being implemented as direct targeted interventions, besides, indirect Multi-sectoral interventions include Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS), National Horticulture Mission, National Food Security Mission, Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS), Nirmal Bharat Abhiyan, National Rural Drinking Water Programme etc.  The National Family Health Survey (NFHS) provides State wise data and the last NFHS-3 Survey was conducted in 2005-06. As per the NFHS-3, the percentage of underweight children under 5 years is 42.5 in whole of the country. The rate of underweight has declined from 42.7% in 1998-99 (NFHS-2) to 40.4% in 2005-06 (NFHS-3) for children below 3 years of age.  In order to address various programmatic, management and institutional gaps and to meet administrative and operational challenges, Government approved the proposal for Strengthening and Restructuring of ICDS Scheme in September 2012 with an over-all budget allocation of Rs. 1,23,580 crore during 12th Five Year Plan.  Restructured and Strengthened ICDS has been rolled out during the year 2012-13 to 2014-15 in a phased manner.

NIRMALA SITHARAMAN)  (a) : Yes, Madam, the external trade deficit between India and China is in favour of China.  (b): The major factors leading to such trade deficit can be found in Chinas Manufacturing sector which is relatively stronger than that of India. Chinese export to India relies strongly on manufactured items which cater to the demand of fast expanding sectors like telecom and power in India along with other low priced products. Subsides provided by Chinese Government to their manufacturing sectors contribute towards the low input costs of Chinese manufactured products. Indias exports to China are comprised of mainly raw materials and low value added intermediate products. The limited market access afforded to Indian products in China is also a contributing factor to the growing trade deficit. Indian IT services exports also face barriers in China and are therefore unable to compensate for the deficit on account of our merchandise trade with China.  (c): Indias bilateral trade with China, during 2013-14, was comprised of imports from China of US$ 51.05 billion and exports from India of US$ 14.83 billion, resulting in a trade balance of US$ 36.22 billion in favour of China.

(e): With a view to reducing trade deficit with China, efforts are being made to diversify the export basket with emphasis on manufactured goods. The Government is also pursuing issues of market access for products with strong export potential, to tackle non-tariff barriers in the Chinese market at different fora, including at the level of Ministerial meeting of the India-China Joint Group on Economic Relations, Trade Science and Technology (JEG). In 2013, three MoUs were signed on products such as bovine meat, fishery products, pharma and an agreement was signed on feed and feed ingredients. Indian exporters are encouraged to participate in major trade fairs in China to show-case Indian products in the Chinese market and increase engagement with Chinese importers. Business to Business relations are encouraged through schemes such as Market Access Initiative (MAI)/Market Development Assistance (MDA). The adverse trade balance is being addressed through augmentation of exports from India to China as well as by encouraging Chinas investing towards building manufacturing capacities in India, through investment in Indias industrial parks, NIMZs, SEZs etc. During the recent visit to China in June, 2014, an MoU on cooperation in Industrial parks has been signed between the two countries which is aimed at attracting Chinese investments in India and provides an enabling framework for Chinese companies to invest in industrial parks and zones. These measures are expected to boost exports and reduce trade deficit to some extent.", "state": ["Gujarat"], "gender": ["Male"], "constituency_type": ["ST"], "party": ["BJP"], "constituency": ["Chhota udaipur"], "month": "July", "day": "18", "year": "2014", "date": "2014-07-18T00:00:00", "date_str": "18-07-2014"}

From the FY 2011-12, the Scheme was extended for housing loan upto Rs.15 lakh, where the cost of house does not exceed Rs.25 lakh. The Scheme was in operation for a period starting from 01.10.2009 to 31.03.2013.  Further, to improve the affordability of housing loans to Economically Weaker Section (EWS)/Lower Income Group (LIG) segments in urban areas, Ministry of Housing and Urban Poverty Alleviation (MHUPA), implemented Interest Subsidy Scheme for Housing the Urban Poor (ISHUP) on 26.12.2008 to provide home loan to EWS/LIG persons for acquisition/construction of house. The Scheme provided a subsidy of 5% for a loan amount upto Rs. 1 lakh for the entire tenure of loan on an upfront basis. The scheme has closed w.e.f. 30.09.2013. MoHUPA has revised the Interest Subsidy Scheme and renamed it as Rajiv Rinn Yojana (RRY), as an additional instrument for addressing the housing needs of EWS/LIG segments in urban areas with effective from 01.10.2013. Under the Scheme, interest subsidy of 5% p.a. is provided on housing loans upto Rs.5 lakh provided by Financial Institutions (FIs) to EWS/LIG borrowers in urban areas.

To comprehensively review the existing methodology of estimation of poverty and examine whether the poverty line should be fixed solely in terms of a consumption basket or whether other criteria are also relevant, and if so, whether the two can be effectively combined to evolve a basis for estimation of poverty in rural and urban areas. ii.    To examine the issue of divergence between consumption estimates based on the NSSO methodology and those emerging from the National Accounts aggregates; and to suggest a methodology for updating consumption poverty lines using the new consumer price indices launched by the CSO for rural and urban areas state-wise. iii.    To review alternative methods of estimation of poverty which may be in use in other countries, including their procedural aspects; and indicate whether on this basis, a particular method can be evolved for empirical estimation of poverty in India, including procedures for updating it over time and across states. iv.

GST is likely to bring about a fundamental change in the tax structure by redistributing the burden of taxation equitably between goods and services. It will broaden the tax base by taxing supplies of goods and services comprehensively. Switching completely to the destination principle will reduce distortions. It will create a tax neutral supply chain. It will foster a common market across the country and reduce compliance costs. It will simplify the indirect tax procedures and would impact scope of manufacture, valuation, input stage credit entitlement, classification and scope of exemptions etc. It will promote exports as hidden costs in the form of multiple taxes will be eliminated. Thus, it will have positive impact on the foreign trade. These will help in spurring growth and employment and consequent increase in country`s GDP.  (c). States` concerns with regard to the GST mainly relate to loss of revenue, fiscal autonomy, compensation, keeping certain items out of GST, subsuming of certain taxes in GST etc.  (d). Government has modified the draft of the Constitution Amendment Bill in accordance with the recommendations of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Finance and the Empowered Committee of State Finance Ministers to address the issues like fiscal autonomy, revenue loss, keeping certain items out of GST, subsuming of certain taxes in GST etc. Government has also assured the States to compensate for any revenue losses incurred by them, from the date of introduction of GST, for a period of three years.  (e). In the spirit of co-operative federalism, no decision to introduce GST will be taken without consulting the States. It is the constant endeavour of the Government to engage with the States on the introduction of this vital reform in the country. Government targets to find a solution in the course of this year and approve the legislative scheme which enables the introduction of GST.", "state": ["West Bengal", "Haryana"], "gender": ["Male", "Male"], "constituency_type": ["GEN", "SC"], "party": ["AITC", "BJP"], "constituency": ["Dum dum", "Ambala"], "month": "July", "day": "18", "year": "2014", "date": "2014-07-18T00:00:00", "date_str": "18-07-2014"}

Domestic consumption of these crops during the last three years and the current year are detailed in Annexure-II. State-wise data of domestic consumption are not maintained by the Government.  (b) : Quantum and value of export and import of tea and coffee during last three years in respect of major destinations and origin countries are given in Annexure-III and Annexure-IV respectively.  (c): Share of India in total world production of tea, coffee, rubber and spices was 25 percent (in 2013), 3.65 percent (in 2012-13), 7 percent (in 2013) and 31 percent (in 2012-13) respectively.

Coffee production declined in 2013-14 due to adverse weather conditions such as rising temperatures coupled with unpredic- table and erratic rainfall, but, coffee exports have shown increase. Production of natural rubber declined during 2013-14 due to prolonged and excessive rainfall and the consequent incidence of leaf diseases. Natural Rubber (NR) is not exported in large quantity as Indias consumption of rubber is larger than domestic production. Export of spices has shown a steady increase despite a marginal decline in the total production compared with 2011-12.  (e) : Government has taken measures to boost the production and export of plantation crops through the Plantation Commodity Boards for tea, coffee, rubber, and spices which provide financial and technical assistance to the growers and the industry for new planting, replanting, rejuvenation, quality up-gradation, value addition and market promotion. The schemes to promote export of plantation crops envisage providing assistance for participation in trade fairs, exhibitions, buyer-seller meets, brand promotion, public relation campaigns and export of value added products.", "state": ["Karnataka"], "gender": ["Male"], "constituency_type": ["GEN"], "party": ["JD(S)"], "constituency": ["Mandya"], "month": "July", "day": "18", "year": "2014", "date": "2014-07-18T00:00:00", "date_str": "18-07-2014"}

The main objective of the proposed course is to create mid- level health professionals who would possess the necessary public health and ambulatory care competencies to serve the rural population and will primarily be deployed at Sub Centres. The curriculum of the course has been prepared in consultation with Medical Council of India (MCI) and has taken into consideration the views of various stakeholders. The degree for the course will be awarded by the respective State Universities and it will be accredited by the National Board of Examinations (NBE) to ensure uniformity in the content and delivery of the course. Further, the States have also been requested to furnish details of financial implications for introducing the course in their Project Implementation Plans (PIPs) under National Rural Health Mission (NRHM).

Further, the Central Government had proposed to amend the IMC Act, 1956 by way of IMC (Amendment) Ordinance, 2013 on 21st May, 2013 inter-alia allowing Overseas Citizens of India (OCIs) to practice medicine in the Country. Subsequently, the Indian Medical Council (Amendment) Bill, 2013 to replace the Ordinance was introduced in the Rajya Sabha on the 19th August 2013. The Bill however could not be taken up for consideration and passing. As the said replacement Bill could not be passed at the expiration of six weeks from the reassembly of Parliament in terms of sub-clause (a) of clause (2) of Article 123 of the constitution, the aforesaid Ordinance ceased to operate on the 16th September, 2013.

Safdarjung Hospital, Dr. RML Hospital and LHMC and associated Hospitals for surgery and treatment is much larger as compared to their handling capacity in terms of number of beds, manpower and other resources. Despite availability of huge infrastructure and other services in these Hospitals, there is a waiting period for certain procedures due to the ever increasing pressure on infrastructure and available manpower in these hospitals, which varies from Department to Department in these Hospitals. As such, various Clinical Departments make their own waiting lists of patients in need of admission taking into consideration the condition of patients, urgency of treatment required and bed availability on a particular day. However, all the patients registered in OPD are given adequate care and attention while providing them clinical treatment.  2. Expansion of existing facilities and creation of new facility in a Hospital is an on- going process and is undertaken as per the requirement and availability of resources. Projects for augmentation of capacity have also been approved in the three Central Government hospitals namely Safdarjung Hospital, Dr. RML Hospital and LHMC and associated Hospitals.  3. In addition, due to space constraint for expansion of AIIMS, New Delhi, the Government is setting up 6 new AIIMS in various States to provide tertiary care to the general public in the respective States/region. Besides this, Government have also taken up up-gradation of 13 existing Government medical college institutions in the first phase under Pradhan Mantri Swasthya Suraksha Yojana (PMSSY) and 6 existing Government medical colleges/ institutions in the second phase of PMSSY, which include improving health infrastructure through construction of Super Speciality Blocks/Trauma centres, etc. and procurement of medical equipment for existing as well as new facilities. In addition, Government has also approved up-gradation of 39 more Medical Colleges under PMSSY.  4.

HARSH VARDHAN)  a) to (e): A statement is laid on the Table of the House STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. 171 FOR 18TH JULY, 2014  a) As per Sample Registration System report 2012 of Registrar General of India, Infant mortality rate in India is 42 per 1000 live births and maternal mortality ratio is 178 per 100,000 live births. As per available WHO / UNICEF global report, 47 countries have higher IMR than India and 52 countries have higher MMR than India.  The prominent causes of death among infants as per RGI-SRS (2001-03) are perinatal conditions (46%), respiratory infections (22%), diarrhoeal disease (10%), other infectious and parasitic diseases (8%), and congenital anomalies (3.1%). The major medical causes of maternal deaths as per RGI-SRS (2001-03) are Haemorrhage (38%), Sepsis (11%), Abortion (8%), Hypertensive disorders (5%), Obstructed labour (5%), and Other causes (34%) including anaemia. Besides this, Illiteracy, low socio-economic status, early age of marriage, high parity, womens empowerment, poor sanitation, hygiene and nutrition, poor access to health facilities are also contributing factors of Infant, Child and maternal mortality.  b) to (d) There are three Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) pertaining to health sector and these are MDG 4 related to child mortality, MDG 5 related to maternal health and MDG 6 related to combating HIV/AIDS, Malaria and other diseases. The status of these goals is as below.  1) MDG 4 target is to reduce the under five mortality rate among children by two-third between 1990 and 2015. In case of India, it translates into a goal of reducing under five mortality rate from 126 per thousand live births in 1990 to 42 in 2015. In 2012, under five mortality rate in India is 52 and it may reach 42 by 2015 if the current trend of annual decline of 6.8 percent continues.  2) MDG 5 target is to reduce maternal mortality ratio by three quarters between 1990 and 2015. This translates to reducing the MMR from 560 in 1990 to 140 in 2015. Indias MMR is likely to reach 141 if 5.7 percent compound rate of annual decline continues.  3) MDG 6 target is to halt and reverse the spread of HIV/AIDS, malaria and other major diseases by 2015. The malaria incidence has come down from 2.57 cases per thousand population in 1990 to 0.88 cases per thousand population. In case of tuberculosis, the prevalence rate has come down from 465 per 100,000 population in 1990 to 230 in 2012 per 100,000 population , achieving 50.54 percent reduction. In case of HIV/AIDS, new annual HIV infections have declined by 57 percent during the last decade from 2.74 lakhs in 2000 to 1.16 lakhs in 2011  e) Reducing child and maternal mortality is a thrust area under the National Health Mission and the key strategies include prevention and treatment of Anaemia by supplementation with Iron and Folic Acid, promotion of institutional delivery through Janani Suraksha Yojana (JSY), strengthening of facility based care for intra- partum and post-partum care to pregnant women during delivery and for sick infants including free entitlements of drugs, diagnostics, diet and referral transport under Janani Shishu Suraksha Karyakram (JSSK), home based new born care through visits by ASHAs, introduction of child health screening for 4Ds i.e. defects at birth, deficiencies, diseases, development delays and their management under Rashtriya Bal Swasthya Karyakram (RBSK), capacity building of health care providers to upgrade their skills to manage Obstetric Care including C-section (EmOC), common new born and childhood diseases and vaccination of children against vaccine preventable diseases under the Universal Immunization Programme.", "state": ["West Bengal", "Bihar"], "gender": ["Female", "Male"], "constituency_type": ["GEN", "GEN"], "party": ["INC", "BJP"], "constituency": ["Maldaha uttar", "Buxar"], "month": "July", "day": "18", "year": "2014", "date": "2014-07-18T00:00:00", "date_str": "18-07-2014"}

Credit Policy guidelines are issued by RBI which is followed not only by Public Sector Banks, but also by all banks in the country.  (c) As per information received from RBI, such information is not available with them. The reasons for rise in NPA of nationalised banks include sluggishness in the domestic growth during the recent past, slowdown in recovery in the global economy and continuing uncertainty in the global markets.  (d) Reserve Bank of India has issued instructions to improve the health of the financial sector; reduce the NPAs; improve asset quality of banks; and to prevent slippages. They stipulate that each bank is to have a Board approved loan recovery policy put in place, an effective mechanism for information sharing for sanction of fresh loans/ad-hoc loans/ renewal of loans to new or existing borrowers, have a robust mechanism for early detection of signs of distress including prompt restructuring in the case of all viable accounts and taking recourse to legal mechanisms like SARFAESI Act, 2002, DRTs and Lok Adalats.  RBI has issued instructions to the Banks to review slippages in asset classification in the borrowal accounts with outstanding of Rs.5 crore and above by the Board of Directors of the bank and review NPA accounts which have registered recoveries of Rs.1 crore and above. RBI also advised banks to strengthen the information sharing mechanism among lenders by making it compulsory for banks to receive/share information on borrowers before sanctioning of loans.  RBI on January 30, 2014, released a Early Recognition of Financial Distress, Prompt Steps for Resolution and Fair Recovery for Lenders: Framework for Revitalizing Distressed Assets in the Economy suggesting various steps for quicker recognition and resolution of stressed assets.  To remove bottlenecks in the recovery of bad debts, the Enforcement of Security Interest and Recovery of Debts Laws (Amendment) Act, 2012 has been passed by Parliament and has come into force from 15.01.2013.  In the budget 2014-15, presented by the Honble Finance Minister, three new Debt Recovery Tribunals have been proposed which would help banks to recover the NPAs. Further, Public Sector Banks were asked to improve the monitoring and recovery efforts with respect to their portfolios.

(ii) Most of these banks are providing standard banking facilities like opening of letters of credit, bill discounting and collection, lockers and safe deposit vaults, bank guarantees etc. Many of these deal in foreign exchange and have also opened ATM kiosks. These banks are thus no different from commercial banks and therefore are not eligible for preferential tax treatment.  (iii) It is in consonance with the objective of the Government to expand the tax base by phasing out all exemptions that are considered economically inefficient and inequitable.  (iv) Income-tax is a tax on profits and there is no rationale for exempting profit-making co-operative banks from payment of income-tax.  Further, the following benefits have also been extended to co-operative banks which have been taken out from the purview of section 80P:-  a. Deduction for provision for doubtful debts, available so far to banking companies,has been extended to co-operative banks;  b. Deduction in respect of special reserve to the extent of 20% of profit, available to financial corporations and banks, has been extended to co-operative banks;  c. Carry forward and set off of business losses has been allowed in the event of amalgamation of a loss making co-operative bank with another co-operative bank.  With this, co-operative banks have been brought at par with commercial banks in so far as the Income-tax Act is concerned.  (c)&(d) The Government has received representations from various quarters seeking restoration of the deduction under Section 80P of the Income-tax Act, 1961 to all cooperative banks.

MCA had requested RBI to initiate action again such Companies. While several Companies in the list were not registered with RBI as NBFCs, the list also did not contain some companies already registered with RBI. Chit Funds are registered and regulated by the State Governments under the Chit Funds Act, 1982. Further, money circulation schemes are prohibited under the Price Chits and Money Circulations (Schemes) Banning Act, 1978 and the States are the implementing agencies under the Act.

(c) & (d): It has been decided by RBI, that as a one-time measure, the financials of all these 34754 Companies (other than those registered with RBI) a list of which has been sent by MCA to RBI would be examined to ascertain their eligibility or otherwise for registration with RBI. The main objective is to determine whether among these companies there are NBFCs that ought to have registered with the RBI for carrying on their NBFI activities. It was found that 4102 Companies were registered with RBI as NBFCs. In the second stage, the RBI focused on the 30652 residual Companies in the MCA list. The focus of exercise was to identify companies which should have been otherwise registered with the RBI. This exercise has further revealed that 13,647 companies are not meeting the Principal Business Criteria (PBC), requiring a certificate of registration for functioning as NBFC, and hence are not required to be registered with the RBI. Further, complete information on 6182 companies is not available in the MCA website. Besides 4125 companies are under liquidation or in the process of being struck off. Of the remaining 6698 companies only 213 are seen to be accepting public deposits and another 1643 are meeting the PBC and minimum net worth requirements.

HARSH VARDHAN)  (a):There are 8.95 Lakh ASHAs and 72616 ANMs engaged under the National Rural Health Mission (NRHM). The state/UT wise details are placed at Annexure I.  (b): The roles and responsibilities of ASHA as envisaged under NRHM are as below:  (i) A facilitator or link worker  where there is low use of health services, the ASHA enables people to access health services  (ii) A volunteer and activist- to enable access to health entitlements and reaching the marginalized.  (iii) A community level care provider- important for her credibility, to respond to local health needs, particularly in underserved areas. ASHAs play an instrumental role in providing home based newborn care through regular home visits in the community.  ASHAs are given performance based incentives in line with their role as honorary volunteers. The list of incentives at national level is at Annexure II.  However, the States may propose and obtain approval for other incentives for ASHAs.  The ANMs are trained frontline health workers. Their role is to provide primary healthcare services at the village level. The services provided by them mainly include promotive and preventive services like; immunization, ANC registration and Check up, family planning counselling, treatment for minor ailments etc. They are given a monthly remuneration as per the norms existing in the state. Further, certain states also provide incentives to ANMs for activities like ensuring timely ANC, serving in difficult/tribal areas etc.  (c) & (d): In the recent past, requests have been received seeking fixed monthly honorarium for ASHAs. The issue has been examined on many occasions and it has been decided to continue with the existing system of performance based incentives in line with the role envisaged for ASHAs under the Mission as honorary volunteers. As regards regularisation of ANMs, under NRHM, the Union Government provides financial support to States /UTs to strengthen the health systems. This includes support for engagement of health workers like ANMs on contractual basis only. This is because NRHM was originally approved by the Cabinet for a period till March 2012 and subsequently has been extended for period till March, 2017 only.  (e): Government has taken various steps to improve functioning of ASHAs and ANMs. In order to motivate the ASHAs at the national level, new activities for ASHAs incentives have been introduced, while the rates of existing incentives have been also been enhanced. States have also been given the flexibility to design appropriate incentives for ASHAs.  A proposal for certification of ASHAs through National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS) has also been approved. Public Health being a state subject, states have also been requested to,-  (i)midentify ASHAs who aspire to obtain academic qualification for Class X or Class XII and to support their registration with the National Institute of Open School (NIOS),  (ii) give priority in admissions into ANM/GNM Training Schools to those ASHAs who are otherwise eligible,  (iii) put in place ASHA rest rooms and grievance redressal mechanisms for ASHAs.  With regard to ANMs, States have been requested to undertake their skill assessment and train them as per the identified gaps besides providing training on skills like IUCD insertion, SBA etc. States have also been supported and encouraged to set up skill labs to refine their clinical skills.", "state": ["Maharashtra"], "gender": ["Female"], "constituency_type": ["GEN"], "party": ["BJP"], "constituency": ["Mumbai north central"], "month": "July", "day": "18", "year": "2014", "date": "2014-07-18T00:00:00", "date_str": "18-07-2014"}

HARSH VARDHAN)  (a): Janani Suraksha Yojana (JSY) is a centrally sponsored scheme which is being implemented with the objective of reducing maternal and infant mortality by promoting institutional delivery among pregnant women. Under the JSY, eligible pregnant women are entitled for cash assistance irrespective of the age of mother and number of children for giving birth in a government or accredited private health facility. The scheme focuses on poor pregnant woman with a special dispensation for states that have low institutional delivery rates, namely, the states of Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Bihar, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Assam, Rajasthan, Orissa, and Jammu and Kashmir. While these states have been named Low Performing States (LPS) under the scheme, the remaining states have been named High Performing states (HPS). The scheme also provides performance based incentives to women health volunteers known as ASHA (Accredited Social Health Activist) for promoting institutional delivery among pregnant women.  Cash Assistance for Institutional Delivery Cash entitlement for different categories of mothers is as follows: In Rupees Category Rural area   Urban area   Mothers ASHAs  Mothers ASHAs    package  package# package  package # # LPS  1400  600  1000  400 HPS  700  600  600  400  # ASHA package of Rs. 600 in rural areas include Rs. 300 for ANC component and Rs. 300 for facilitating institutional delivery.  # # ASHA package of Rs. 400 in urban areas include Rs. 200 for ANC component and Rs. 200 for facilitating institutional delivery. Cash assistance for home delivery  BPL pregnant women, who prefer to deliver at home, are entitled to a cash assistance of Rs 500 per delivery regardless of the age of pregnant and number of children.  Direct Benefits Transfer under JSY  Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) mode of payments has been rolled out in 43 districts w.e.f. 1.1.2013 and in 78 districts from 1.7.2013. Under this initiative, eligible pregnant women are entitled to get JSY benefit directly into their bank accounts.  (b): The details of fund allocated and number of women benefitted under the JSY during the last three years is at Annexure-1& 2.  As a result of General Elections-2014, the process of approval of State Programme Implementation Plans for the financial year 2014-15 which includes approval of JSY funds also is currently underway, however; in order to ensure that there shall be no interruption in the implementation of JSY, States have been directed to implement the JSY scheme out of unspent funds/savings of the previous year under NRHM lying with States.  Percentage decline in infant mortality rate and maternal mortality ratio, State/UT wise is at Annexure-3 & 4.  (c): The fact that the number of beneficiaries under Janani Suraksha Yojana has increased manifold i.e. from 7.38 lakhs beneficiaries in 2005-06 to 106.48 lakhs in 2013-14, itself is an indicator of high awareness levels among the pregnant women about the scheme. Also, about 9 lakh ASHA workers get performance based incentives under JSY for motivating pregnant women to give birth in a health facility by creating awareness about the scheme. Further, large majority of JSY beneficiaries are from rural background as out of the total beneficiaries reported in 2013-14, nearly 87% women belong to rural areas and to say that a large segment of pregnant women in the rural areas of the country are not aware of the scheme and deprived of the benefits under the scheme may not hold true.

However, should a bank, in its own judgment, decide to outsource a financial services activity, necessary safeguards for addressing the risks inherent in such outsourcing should be put in place, as detailed in the aforementioned guidelines.

Three of the six services viz. immunization, health check-up and referral services are related to health and are provided by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare through NRHM and Public Health Infrastructure.  (b) &(c): Since the existing calorific norms were not adequately meeting the gap between Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) and Average Dietary Intake (ADI), Government of India after due deliberations and taking into account the recommendations of experts, issued comprehensive revised nutritional and feeding norms on 24.2.2009. These guidelines specified the kind of supplementary nutrition to be provided to children in the age group of 0-6 months, 6 months to 3 years and 3-6 years as well as for pregnant women and lactating mothers. All the States/UTs have been advised to follow these guidelines so that the purpose for which these were issued is achieved.

This is done largely through monitoring reports and review meetings.  Besides the review meetings at the national and State level, implementation of the scheme is monitored through Monthly Progress Reports and Quarterly Progress Reports sent by the States /UTs to the Government of India. Being a highly decentralized programme, a Five-tier Monitoring mechanism with defined tasks has also been assigned to monitor the progress of implementation of the scheme at all the levels viz. national, State, district, block and the Anganwadi level. MIS has also been revised under the strengthening and restructuring of ICDS, recently approved by the Government. Shortcomings, if any, noticed in achieving the desired level of target in respect of above issues are brought to the notice of the States/UTs for necessary remedial actions.  Strengthening and Restructuring of ICDS including revision of SNP norms is also a step in the direction for improving the delivery system of SNP.

The devaluation/depreciation of the currency generally does not impact economic growth directly. It can indirectly impact economic growth through an effect on exports and imports. In view of this, it is difficult to arrive at the precise estimate of the impact of depreciation of Rupee on economic growth. Depreciation can boost certain sectors as exports of Indian companies become cheaper in the international market. On the other hand, imports become dearer which can constrain output in certain sectors/companies which are highly dependent on imported inputs. Depreciation may also have adverse implications for domestic entities with foreign currency debt component in their balance sheets, particularly, if foreign currency liabilities are not adequately hedged. There is no one-to-one direct relationship between depreciation of the rupee and exports and imports of the country, as can be seen from the following table.

As per information received from central intelligence and investigating agencies, FICN have been sourced from neighboring countries with the help of self sustaining criminal networks operating in South and South-East Asian Region.  (d) : The Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Home Affairs, RBI, Security and Intelligence Agencies of the Centre and States, Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) etc., are working in tandem to thwart the illegal activities related to FICNs. One special FICN Coordination (FCORD) Group has been formed in the Ministry of Home Affairs to share the intelligence/ information amongst different security agencies of State/Centre to counter the menace of circulation of fake currency notes in the country. It also coordinates with different security agencies to effect more seizures. This group also coordinates all the matters relating to intelligence collection and collation in India and abroad for the member agencies. CBI and NIA are the central agencies for investigation of FICN cases. A Terror Funding & Fake Currency Cell is functioning in NIA to focus on terror funding & fake currency cases. Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata has been assigned to undertake a study on FICN issues, including estimation of FICN in circulation under the overall supervision of NIA. A simplified mechanism for reporting and filing of FIR in FICN cases has been put in place. The issue has been raised in international multilateral fora constantly.  The Reserve Bank of India has also taken following steps in this regard:  (i) RBI regularly conducts training programmes on detection of counterfeit notes for employees / officers of banks and other organisations handling large amount of cash.  (ii) RBI initiated several measures for generating public awareness through posting information on its website, releasing posters/leaflets, conducting awareness programmes etc.  (iii) Instructions have been issued to banks that banknotes in denominations of ` 100/- and above should be re-issued by banks over their counters or through ATMs only if these banknotes are duly checked for authenticity/genuineness and fitness by machines.  (iv) The process of reporting and detection of counterfeit notes has been streamlined and rationalized in order to safeguard the interests of common man coming across counterfeit notes unknowingly. Under the revised procedure, all cases of detection of counterfeit notes at the bank branches / treasuries are required to be promptly reported to Police Authorities in the following manner:  (a) For cases of detection of counterfeit notes upto 4 pieces, in a single transaction, a consolidated report as per the format prescribed is sent to the police authorities at the end of the month.  (b) For cases of detection of counterfeit notes of 5 or more pieces, in a single transaction, FIRs is lodged with the Nodal Police Station / Police Authorities as per jurisdiction.  (v) In order to train bank staff engaged in cash handling on features of Indian banknotes, IBA has been advised to ensure training to all such personnel within a period of 3 years. RBI also provides faculty support and training materials.  (vi) The banks have been advised to ensure that the notes received over the counters are re-circulated only after ensuring their proper authentication through machines.  (vii) Instructions have been issued to the banks, in terms of which for the counterfeit notes detected at the back office/currency chest of the bank, the banks will be compensated at the rate of 25% of the notional value of counterfeit notes in denomination of `100 and above for the loss incurred by them towards detection of such counterfeit notes subject to reporting to RBI and Police.", "state": ["Uttar Pradesh", "Bihar", "Karnataka"], "gender": ["Male", "Male", "Male"], "constituency_type": ["GEN", "GEN", "ST"], "party": ["BJP", "RJD", "BJP"], "constituency": ["Gorakhpur", "Bhagalpur", "Bellary"], "month": "July", "day": "18", "year": "2014", "date": "2014-07-18T00:00:00", "date_str": "18-07-2014"}

Higher international oil prices can also have implications for domestic inflation and fiscal deficit, depending on the pass-through of higher international oil prices to the domestic economy and the rise in energy cost. Further, business sentiments can be affected by such uncertainties. The problems in Iraq had pushed up the international crude oil prices in the second and third week of June 2014, which, however, declined subsequently.

The Government is aiming for an adequate and effective legal and institutional framework mandating zero waste mining as the ultimate goal and a commitment to prevent sub-optimal and unscientific mining. Mineral sectoral value addition through latest technique of beneficiation, calibration, blending, sizing, concentration, pelletisation, purification and general customising of product is being encouraged.  As regulators, Indian Bureau of Mines (IBM) and State Government approve the mining plan /scheme of mining for systematic and optimum utilisation/extraction of mineral.  As per the provisions of Mineral Conservation and Development Rules 1988, IBM carries out periodical inspections of mines to monitor conservation of minerals, systematic and scientific mining and protection of environment in the leasehold areas of minerals other than minor minerals, coal and atomic minerals.  IBM has notified the threshold values of minerals viz. Apatite and Rock Phosphate, Bauxite, Barytes, Chromite, Dolomite, Fluorite, Iron Ore, Limestone, Magnesite, Manganese Ore and Wollastonite and directed the mine owners that all the non-saleable/un-usable minerals/ ores above the limit prescribed in the threshold values are required to be stacked separately in the area earmarked for the purpose and maintain a mineral/ore stock indicating the quantity and quality of material stacked.  IBM has conducted studies such as process-mineralogy, analytical and physical characterization, analysis of samples from the waste dump, mineral rejects, sub-grade minerals stacks in the direction of zero waste mining.  Through mineral processing, IBM has upgraded low grade ore/ mineral resources by discarding deleterious constituents thus playing a significant role in conservation of mineral resources by recovering saleable product from them.  IBM is actively engaged in Research &Development work and over sixty odd different minerals of various types of consumer industry namely, metallic & non-metallic minerals, industrial minerals, strategic minerals, fertilizer minerals etc, were tested, characterized and beneficiated at IBMs Laboratories and Pilot Plant.  Iron and Steel Vision 2020 has been published in which issues of beneficiation of low grade ores, fines and slimes, development of agglomeration activities including pelletisation of beneficiated fines, use of pellets in iron making for conservation of limited high grade lumps have been addressed in detail to steer a way to the future.", "state": ["Uttar Pradesh"], "gender": ["Female"], "constituency_type": ["GEN"], "party": ["AD"], "constituency": ["Mirzapur"], "month": "July", "day": "21", "year": "2014", "date": "2014-07-21T00:00:00", "date_str": "21-07-2014"}

When the inquiry or trial relates to the offence of rape under section 376, 376A, 376B, 376C or 376D of the Indian Penal Code, the inquiry or trial shall, as far as possible be completed within a period of two months from the date of filing of the charge sheet. The power of granting or refusing adjournments is in the domain of the judiciary. Enforcement as well as monitoring of the said provision also lies in the hands of the judiciary. However the Government has periodically invited the attention of all High Courts on granting of indiscriminate adjournments in criminal cases which is causing delay in the disposal of cases including the trial of heinous offences. Government has also requested Chief Justices of all High Courts to invite the attention of the district judges to these provisions and impress upon them to adhere to them in trial of cases involving heinous crimes such as rape.  (d): The Central Government supported the establishment of Fast Track Courts for heinous crimes from the period 2000-2011, first through the funds awarded under the 11th Finance Commission and, later, by providing Central assistance to States. The central funding for Fast Track Courts has been stopped since 31st March, 2011. More recently Government has-been supporting the State Governments and providing assistance under various schemes for subordinate judiciary. Government has also requested State Governments and the Chief Justices of High Courts to utilise 10% additional posts of judges being created in subordinate judiciary in pursuance of the direction of Supreme Court in Brij Mohan Lai case, for setting-up of Fast Track Courts also. For meeting expenditure on salaries of these 10% additional posts, Central Government has decided to provide funds up to a maximum of Rs. 80 crore per annum on a matching basis up to 31.03.2015 from the 13th Finance Commission Award.

However, siting clearances of DoT are issued without prejudice to other applicable bylaws, rule and regulations of local bodies such as municipal corporation, Gram Panchayat etc. Accordingly, before installation of tower, the telecom service providers have to obtain necessary clearances from concerned local authorities/ State Government bodies also. Various local bodies/State Government have formulated their own policy regarding grant of such permissions for installation of mobile towers. DoT, has issued advisory guidelines for state governments on 23.08.2012 for issue of clearance for installation of mobile towers and the same has been forwarded to the Chief Secretaries of all State Governments. The above said guidelines have been further revised with effect from 01.08.2013.  (b) & (c) The site location for tower installation is decided by Telecom Service Providers as per their business and technical requirements. As on 31.05.2014, there are approx 8,01,000 total number of Base Transceiver Stations (BTSs) installed at mobile towers all over the country including those in residential areas, public buildings, schools etc. as there is no restriction on installation of mobile BTSs in such areas.  (d) DoT does not maintain the information about grant of permissions for installation of mobile towers by State Government bodies / Local authorities.  (e) World Health Organization (WHO) in its Fact Sheet No. 304, May 2006 on Electro Magnetic Fields (EMF) and Public Health (Base Stations and Wireless Technologies) has concluded that considering the very low exposure levels and research results collected to date, there is no convincing scientific evidence that the weak Radio Frequency (RF) Signals from base stations and wireless networks cause adverse health effects. From all evidence accumulated so far, no adverse short or long term health effects have been shown to occur from the RF Signals produced by base stations (mobile phone towers). WHO, after studying approximately 25,000 studies over past 30 years has concluded that current evidence does not confirm the existence of any health consequences from exposure to EMF radiation. Continuous studies are being carried out nationally as well as internationally to study health effect of EMF radiation from mobile towers. So far there is no conclusive scientific evidence of any adverse health effect due to RF emission from mobile phone towers. Therefore, the need to consider any compensation does not arise. WHO has recommended that National authorities should adopt international standards to protect their citizens against adverse levels of RF fields. They should restrict access to areas where exposure limits may be exceeded. WHO has referred to the International Exposure Guidelines developed by International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP). Department of Telecommunication (DoT) has made an assessment of health effects of EMF radiations and prescribed stricter precautionary limits for EMF radiation from mobile tower. The present prescribed limits for EMF radiations from Base Station in India are one-tenth (1/10th) of internationally prescribed limits of ICNIRP. In a Writ Petition filed in Honble High Court Allahabad, Lucknow bench, the Honble Court vide its order dated 10.01.2012 constituted a committee consisting of Members of IITs Bombay, Kharagpur, Kanpur, Delhi, Roorkee and other prominent persons of other scientific institutions of the country like AIIMS (Delhi), Indian Council of Medical Research, etc who has submitted its report on 17-01-2014. After due consideration of the human health concerns on account of EMF radiation being raised in public and the Report of the Committee, the Government has decided in February 2014 that the present prescribed precautionary EMF safe exposure limits are adequate and need no further change at this stage. Further, Telecom Enforcement Resource & Monitoring (TERM) field units of DoT are ensuring compliance to the prescribed stricter precautionary norms of EMF from mobile tower through extensive audit of comprehensive compliance self-certificates being submitted by telecom service providers and Base Transceiver Station (BTS) sites. This is regularly done by TERM units for the purpose of limiting the EMF radiation exposure and keeping general public areas in the vicinity of towers safe. In case, any BTS site is found to violate the prescribed EMF norms, actions are taken to put a penalty of Rs. 10 lakh per BTS per incidence including closing of BTS site as per the prescribed procedure.", "state": ["Odisha", "Andhra Pradesh", "Maharashtra"], "gender": ["Male", "Male", "Male"], "constituency_type": ["GEN", "GEN", "GEN"], "party": ["BJD", "TDP", "BJP"], "constituency": ["Cuttack", "Hindupur", "Akola"], "month": "July", "day": "21", "year": "2014", "date": "2014-07-21T00:00:00", "date_str": "21-07-2014"}

The Department of Electronics and Information Technology (DeitY) has launched the Common Services Centres (CSCs) scheme to promote and develop information technology in rural areas of the country.  The CSC Scheme, as approved by the Government of India in September 2006 for setting up of more than 100,000 internet enabled centres in rural India, envisions CSCs as the front-end delivery points for Government, private and social sector services to rural citizens of the country in an integrated manner. As on date, 1,34,589 CSCs have been rolled out covering all the 36 States/UTs.  (b): Yes, Madam. The Government of India is aware that regional language barriers have impeded the e-Governance initiatives in rural India. India is a multilingual country with 22 official languages. Less than 10 percent of the people in the country can read & write English. There are various issues regarding Indian languages such as orthography (spelling issues), pronunciation (may be directly mapped but not always), one script for many languages & many languages with one script, etc.  The mobile web in regional languages also has many challenges such as character encoding, bandwidth cost, presentation issues, device limitations, lack of standardization, fonts, backward compatibility with legacy devices, rendering issues, lack of availability for all characters, issue of multiple scripts, standardization of glyph support, syllable composition and logic dependency on the implementation level of handset manufacturer.  Further there are issues with software applications, e.g. some applications are completely in English, some applications have static content in local language but forms in English and some applications are multi-lingual but only in limited languages (e.g.English and only one local language).  (c): Yes, Madam. DeitY is implementing Localisation Projects Management Framework (LPMF) project which envisages to make Government websites and online services available to the citizens in their own languages. A portal http://localization.gov.in has been launched on 18th Feb 2014 for dissemination of information and providing basic localization tools and services.  Besides this, under the Technology Development for Indian Languages (TDIL) Programme, free language CDs containing language computing tools for 22 constitutionally recognized Indian languages including Hindi have been developed. There are about 250 training centers (Programme for Advancing Computer Education - PACE) under CDAC (centre for Development of Advanced Computing) in rural and urban areas which impart training in language technology software usage.  (d): Government of India has taken various initiatives to dismantle Urban-Rural digital divide and reach out to rural population effectively.  i. Common Services Centres (CSCs): CSCs are the front-end delivery points for Government, private and social sector services to rural citizens of the country in an integrated manner. A Rural Outreach campaign has been conducted in 9 states (Himachal Pradesh, Assam, Meghalaya, Manipur, Tripura, Odisha, Kerala, Jharkhand and Maharashtra) covering 1,282 CSCs during 2013-14. The aim of campaign is to promote and create awareness about the services being delivered by the CSCs among the rural population.  ii. Technology Development for Indian Languages (TDIL): Under TDIL program, language CDs can be freely downloaded from http://www.ildc.nic.in and are also being sent by post to the doorstep of any user free of cost on request. Using software contained in these language CDs, a rural user can carry out various activities like letter/application writing, content creation, database creation, presentation making, online messaging, e-mailing and web browsing etc. in local languages.  iii. Localisation Projects Management Framework (LPMF): Under LPMF project, tools, resources and services are being developed. In 2014-15, 15 additional URLs covering another 7 MMPs have been taken up for development and deployment of the Surface Localization Plug-in on http:// localization.gov.in/. The final deployment of LPMF has been planned to be hosted on cloud platform.

Statement referred to in reply to parts (a) to (d) of Lok Sabha Starred Question No. 186 asked by Shri P. Karunakaran and Shri Rakesh Singh to be answered on 21.7.2014 regarding `Rising Demand of Crude Oil.  (a): As per Oil Import Estimates-2014-15, the current projected demand of crude oil for processing during the year 2014-15 is estimated at 223.7 MMT of which 35.5 MMT will come from indigenous production and balance 188.2 MMT shall have to be imported to bridge the gap.  The total demand of petroleum products for the year 2014-15 is projected to be 159.98 MMT. Product-wise demand of petroleum products during 2014-15 is given at Annexure-I. The details of the quantum of crude oil being imported from various countries, country-wise during last five years i.e. 2009-10 to 2013-14, are given at Annexure-II.  (b) & (c): The Government, through Indian Strategic Petroleum Reserves Limited (ISPRL), is setting up Strategic Crude Oil Reserves with storage capacity of 5.33 Million Metric Tonnes (MMT) at three locations viz. Visakhapatnam (storage capacity: 1.33 MMT), Mangalore (storage capacity: 1.5 MMT) and Padur (storage capacity: 2.5 MMT) to enhance the energy security of the country.  The Visakhapatnam Project is expected to be completed by the end of this financial year, whereas the Mangalore and Padur projects are expected to be completed next year.  Based on an approach paper prepared by the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, in December 2009, the aforesaid reserves being created in Phase-I would provide a cover of approximately 13 days on the basis of net oil imports. Based on the crude oil and product storages already existing with the oil companies and also taking into consideration the storages being built by ISPRL, it was estimated that to have a total cover of 90 days on net oil imports, as suggested in the Integrated Energy Policy (IEP), the country would require additional crude oil storage of approximately 13.32 MMT by the year 2019-20.  (d): Government and Exploration and Production Companies have taken several steps to enhance domestic oil and gas productions including:  1) Implementation of improved oil recovery and enhanced oil recovery schemes by ONGC from ageing fields.  2) Enhanced exploitation of Coal Bed Methane (CBM)  3) Policy for Geo-Scientific Data Generation for Hydrocarbons  4) Setting up of a National Data Repository.  5) Enhanced exploitation of Shale Gas reserves etc.  6) Increased efforts for acquisition of oil and gas assets abroad.", "state": ["Kerala", "Madhya Pradesh"], "gender": ["Male", "Male"], "constituency_type": ["GEN", "GEN"], "party": ["CPM", "BJP"], "constituency": ["Kasaragod", "Jabalpur"], "month": "July", "day": "21", "year": "2014", "date": "2014-07-21T00:00:00", "date_str": "21-07-2014"}

Statement referred to in reply to parts (a) to (c) of the Lok Sabha Starred Question No. 188 to be answered on 21.07.2013 regarding `Transparency in Appointment of Judges`.  (a)to (c) : The appointment of Judges to High Courts and Supreme Court is based on a Memorandum of Procedure for Appointment of Judges of Supreme Court and High Courts prepared in 1998 pursuant to the Supreme Court Judgement of October 6, 1993 read with their Advisory Opinion of October 28, 1998. Recommendations have been made in the past by the National Commission to Review the Working of the Constitution (2002), 2nd Administrative Reforms Commission (2007-08) and the Law Commission of India (214th Report-2008) for changing the existing procedure for appointment of Judges to die Supreme Court and High Courts. Representations have also been made by various agencies and expert bodies to review/change the present procedure of appointment of judges.  Based on the suggestions received, the Government had introduced two bills titled the `Constitution (One Hundred and Twentieth Amendment) Bill, 2013` and the `Judicial Appointments Commission Bill, 2013` in the Rajya Sabha to change die existing system for appointment and transfer of Judges in the Supreme Court and High Courts by establishing a Judicial Appointments Commission (JAC).  The objective of the Bills is to broad base the process of appointment, and make it more participatory to ensure greater transparency and objectivity in the appointments to the higher judiciary. The Bills proposed that the JAC would be headed by the Chief Justice of India (CJI) and would consist of two other Judges of the Supreme Court next to the CJI in seniority, Union Minister in charge of Law and Justice and two eminent persons to be nominated by Collegium consisting of the Prime Minister, CJI and the Leader of Opposition in the House of People. One of such eminent person shall be nominated by rotation from amongst the persons belonging to the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, Other Backward Classes, and Minorities.  The `Constitution (One Hundred and Twentieth Amendment) Bill, 2013`, which was an enabling legislation for JAC, was passed by the Rajya Sabha on 5th September, 2013 as the `Constitution (Ninety Ninth Amendment) Bill, 2013`. However, `The Judicial Appointments Commission Bill. 2013` was referred to the Department-Related Parliamentary Standing Committee (PSC) on Personnel, Public Grievances, Law and Justice for examination.  The Parliamentary Standing Committee presented its report on the Judicial Appointments Commission, Bill, 2013 on 9th December. 2013 to Parliament. After examining the report, necessary amendments were made in the Constitution (One Hundred and Twentieth Amendment) Bill and the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill, 2013. However, the Bills could not be considered in the last Session of the Parliament. The Constitution (One Hundred and Twentieth Amendment) Bill has lapsed consequent to the dissolution of the 15 Lok Sabha. The `Judicial Appointments Commission Bill, 2013` is pending in the Rajya Sabha. The Government is seeking the views of various political parties and eminent Jurists on the proposal for setting up of a `Judicial Appointments Commission`.", "state": ["Uttar Pradesh", "Kerala"], "gender": ["Male", "Male"], "constituency_type": ["GEN", "GEN"], "party": ["BJP", "INC"], "constituency": ["Gorakhpur", "Alappuzha"], "month": "July", "day": "21", "year": "2014", "date": "2014-07-21T00:00:00", "date_str": "21-07-2014"}
