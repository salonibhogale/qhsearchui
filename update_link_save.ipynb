The University Grants Commission (UGC) had, in its 510th meeting held on 7th October, 2015, considered the report of its Expert Committee for framing guidelines and also for considering enhancement of non-National Eligibility Test (NET) fellowships and resolved to discontinue the scheme. The Central Government directed the UGC on 28th October, 2015 not to implement the Commissions decision discontinuing the Non-NET fellowships and to continue all existing and continuing fellowships, NET as well as Non-NET. It was decided that the existing awards under Non-NET fellowships will not be reduced rather expanded and that guidelines for selection, coverage, award and administration of Non-NET fellowships be developed to enable an enhancement in these fellowships.  The Government appointed a Committee on 28th October, 2015, under the chairpersonship of Prof. Gautam Barua, former Director, Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Guwahati to go into the issues related to the research fellowships provided by the UGC, covering both NET fellowships and Non-NET fellowships. The details of the committee are available at http://mhrd.gov.in/sites/upload_files/mhrd/files/ ReviewUGCFellowships.pdf .  (c): No such action has been taken by the Government against Teachers Association.
